# Platform Documentation

> **📝 This folder is for YOUR documentation!**

As you work through the Module 03 exercises, you'll create documentation files here:

## Expected Files

After completing the exercises, this folder should contain:

- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` — System architecture and data flow diagrams
- [ ] `PATTERNS.md` — Documented patterns (and inconsistencies) found in the codebase
- [ ] `CONVENTIONS.md` — Proposed coding standards and conventions

## Why This Matters

When Marcus joined TechMart, this folder was empty. Every question required digging through code or asking colleagues who might not know the answer.

The documentation you create here becomes **leverage**—it multiplies your effort by helping everyone who reads it.

## Getting Started

Start with Exercise 1 in Module 03:

1. Trace how an order flows through the system
2. Document the service interactions
3. Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` with diagrams and explanations

Good luck! 🚀
