- Classes/types: PascalCase; variables/functions: camelCase

## Folder Layout

- `src/` for application code; `tests/` for tests
- Group by feature or layer; be consistent

## Imports & Dependencies

- Absolute vs. relative imports: choose one; be consistent
- Approved external deps list; review new ones

## Style

- Formatter and linter settings
- Comment style and doc blocks

## Commits & PRs

- Conventional commits (or your standard)
- Small PRs with clear description and acceptance criteria
