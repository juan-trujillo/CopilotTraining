agentic-issues.  by having agents combs/compile/research/plan issues, it gets us closer to just "assign this to copilot". That seems to be the closest "easy button" for teams to adopt, and also the most direct way to get value out of agents without needing to rewire your entire SDLC.  need to add a section on this to the agentic-sdlc talk, and then add a link to it in the decision guide for teams who want to dip their toes in the water before doing a full SDLC transformation.

add some meat around the statement "Guidance over Governance".  EAs seems to want to bring all their bad habits/assumptions to agentic delivery.

---

evergreen process: using Actions to view all changesets at PR approval and updating agents/instructions/docs each time.  maybe refernce https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/

---

let's implement functionality for one-off talks/slidevs.  never published to pages, just live locally in the repo to be run manually.

---

lots of temp work around copilot-cli.  look in "harness" folder

---

either fix or delete the ISSUE-based generation.  Probably delete, it breaks promises.
