# Copilot Memory: Stateful AI That Remembers Your Preferences

> **The Question This Talk Answers:**
> *"How do I stop re-explaining my coding style, workflow preferences, and project context to Copilot every session?"*

**Duration:** 40 minutes | **Target Audience:** Developers / Team Leads

---

## 📊 Content Fitness

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Relevant** | 🟢 High | Every developer using Copilot experiences session reset frustration — memory eliminates constant re-explanation |
| **Compelling** | 🟢 High | Transforms AI from stateless to stateful — preferences persist, context survives across sessions, personal customization at scale |
| **Actionable** | 🟢 High | Single setting enables feature, 5 minutes to store first preference, immediate impact on next session |

**Overall Status:** 🟢 Ready to use

---


## The Problem

### Key Points

- **Context resets every session**
  Each new chat starts with a blank slate — AI forgets preferences, conventions, and project decisions from previous conversations

- **Repeated explanations waste time**
  "Always use PEP 8 formatting." "Remember, we prefer functional components." "Don't forget error boundaries." — same instructions, every session

- **Preferences never stick**
  Personal coding style, communication format, workflow preferences must be re-stated constantly, breaking flow and wasting cognitive effort

- **Onboarding never completes**
  Even after months of use, AI still asks basic questions about your preferences that you've answered dozens of times

### Narrative

Every developer using Copilot hits the same frustration: you spend 20 minutes explaining your project's conventions, security requirements, and coding style. The AI gives great suggestions. The next day, you open a new chat — and it's forgotten everything. You explain it all again. And again. This isn't a limitation of the AI's reasoning ability; it's the ephemeral nature of session context.

Copilot receives your workspace files, but not your personal preferences. It knows your codebase structure, but not why you chose certain patterns. It sees your current question, but not that you always want concise bullet-point explanations with code examples. Each session starts fresh, requiring the same context-setting work every time.

This repetition taxes cognitive load and breaks flow. Developers stop asking for help because explaining preferences takes longer than writing the code. The promise of AI assistance gets drowned in the overhead of re-onboarding the AI every conversation.

Copilot Memory eliminates this by introducing **stateful context** — the AI remembers what matters and applies it automatically.

---

## The Solution: Copilot Memory

### What It Does

Copilot Memory provides persistent storage of preferences, conventions, and decisions that survives across chat sessions. An agent-accessible memory tool automatically saves important context when you share it and retrieves relevant memories when starting new conversations.

### Key Capabilities

- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Preferences saved in one chat automatically apply in all future sessions — no re-explanation needed
- **Intelligent Storage**: Agent recognizes what's memory-worthy (style preferences, workflow patterns) vs. ephemeral (current file bug fixes)
- **Automatic Retrieval**: Relevant memories surface contextually based on what you're working on — architectural decisions appear during planning, coding style during implementation
- **Full User Control**: View, edit, delete any memory through GitHub settings — complete transparency and governance

### Architecture Overview

The memory tool operates as an agent-accessible capability. When you share preferences explicitly ("Remember: I prefer early returns") or implicitly (agent infers patterns from corrections), the tool evaluates persistence-worthiness. Important preferences get stored linked to your GitHub account. In future sessions, the tool retrieves relevant memories based on conversation context — working on authentication? Redis cache decision surfaces. Writing validation logic? Early return preference applies.

Storage is encrypted and privacy-respecting. The tool never stores secrets, file contents, or session-specific instructions. Memories sync across VS Code, GitHub.com, and CLI — enabling consistent assistance regardless of where you work.

This transforms Copilot from a stateless assistant (forgets everything) to a **stateful collaborator** (builds context over time).

## 🎯 Mental Model Shift

> **The Core Insight:** From "every session starts with re-explanation" to "AI builds context over time like a long-term collaborator"

### Move Toward (Embrace These Patterns)

- ✅ **Explicit Persistence Markers**: Use "Remember for future sessions:" or "From now on, always..." to signal memory-worthy preferences → AI confidently stores and applies them
- ✅ **Curated Memory Profiles**: Build a growing collection of your most important preferences over weeks → Personalized AI assistant that works how you work
- ✅ **Memory-First Communication Style**: Tell the AI once, benefit forever — invest 2 minutes upfront to save 5-10 minutes per session indefinitely
- ✅ **Layered Customization**: Combine memory (personal) + instructions (team) + agents (specialized) → Team consistency with individual customization

### Move Away From (Retire These Habits)

- ⚠️ **Session Start Context Dumps**: Explaining preferences at the beginning of every chat because "it forgets" → Memory eliminates this entirely
- ⚠️ **Inline Corrections Without Storage**: Fixing AI responses but not telling it to remember the correction → Wastes future time re-correcting the same pattern
- ⚠️ **Preference Duplication Across Features**: Putting personal style in team instructions, custom agents, and repeated chat messages → Memory is the right layer for individual preferences

### Move Against (Active Resistance Required)

- 🛑 **Storing Secrets in Memory**: API keys, passwords, or credentials — memory is persistent and synced → Use environment variables and secret management instead
- 🛑 **Memory as a Replacement for Documentation**: Important team decisions belong in ADRs, not individual memories → Memory is personal, docs are shared

> **Example Transformation:** Before: "I prefer concise bullet-point explanations" repeated in 40 chat sessions over 2 months (200 minutes wasted). After: Store once, agent applies automatically in all 40 sessions (2 minutes invested, 198 minutes saved — 99x ROI).

## When to Use This Pattern

### Decision Tree

```
Q: What type of context needs persistence?
├─ Personal preferences (coding style, communication format, workflow)
│  → Use: Copilot Memory
│  └─ Best for: Cross-project preferences that follow you
│
├─ Team standards (coding conventions, architecture patterns)
│  → Use: Custom Instructions in repository
│  └─ Best for: Shared context everyone must follow
│
├─ Project-specific decisions (tech choices, historical context)
│  → Combine: Memory (why) + Instructions (what)
│  └─ Best for: Architectural rationale that persists personally
│
└─ Session-specific context (current bug, refactoring task)
   → Use: Ephemeral chat context (don't store)
   └─ Best for: One-time tasks without lasting relevance
```

### Use This Pattern When

- You work across multiple projects but maintain consistent personal coding style
- You've explained the same preferences more than 3 times
- AI responses don't match your preferred communication format
- Historical project decisions keep getting lost between sessions

### Don't Use This Pattern When

- Context is session-specific ("fix line 47 bug") — ephemeral chat handles this
- Information is sensitive (secrets, PII) — use secure secret management
- Standards apply to entire team — use custom instructions instead
- You haven't validated the preference yet — experiment first, memorize once confirmed

### Comparison with Related Features

| Aspect | Copilot Memory | Custom Instructions | Custom Agents |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Best For** | Personal preferences | Team standards | Specialized behaviors |
| **Scope** | Cross-project, follows your account | Per-repository or path | Task-specific workflows |
| **Sharing** | Individual only | Version controlled, team-wide | Repository-based |
| **Management** | GitHub Settings UI | Files in repo | Agent definition files |
| **Setup Time** | 1 setting, 5 minutes | 15-30 minutes | 1-2 hours |

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: How Memory Works -->
## How Copilot Memory Works

*Understanding the agent-accessible memory tool and storage lifecycle*

### The Memory Tool Architecture

The agent has access to a `memory` tool with two primary operations:

**Store Operation:**
```
User: "From now on, always ask clarifying questions when
       requirements seem ambiguous—don't make assumptions."

Agent: "I'll remember this preference. In future sessions,
        I'll ask for clarification rather than assuming
        when requirements are unclear."

[Memory Tool: Save]
Content: "Ask clarifying questions when requirements seem
         ambiguous instead of making assumptions"
Scope: All future sessions
```

**Retrieve Operation:**
```
[New chat session starts]

User: "Help me implement user authentication"

[Memory Tool: Retrieve relevant memories]
Found: "Always include rollback strategy in implementation plans"
Found: "Prefer TypeScript strict mode"
Found: "Communication format: bullet points with code examples"

Agent: [Applies remembered preferences automatically]
```

### Storage Decision Logic

The agent evaluates whether information should persist using these criteria:

| Input Type | Storage Decision | Reason |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| "Always use X pattern" | ✅ Store | Explicit future-tense instruction |
| "I prefer Y format" | ✅ Store | Personal style preference |
| "We chose Z because..." | ✅ Store | Historical decision context |
| "Fix bug on line 47" | ❌ Don't store | Session-specific |
| "API key: abc123" | ❌ Don't store | Security risk |
| "Try approach A first" | ❌ Don't store | Ephemeral experiment |

The tool errs on the side of asking permission when ambiguous — if it's unclear whether something should persist, the agent will confirm: "Should I remember this for future sessions?"

### Retrieval and Application

Memories aren't dumped into every conversation. The tool retrieves contextually:

- **Working on authentication** → Surfaces security-related memories and past OAuth decisions
- **Writing validation logic** → Applies coding style preferences like "early returns"
- **Explaining concepts** → Uses communication format memories (bullet points vs paragraphs)

**Retrieval is semantic:** The tool matches based on meaning, not keywords. If you stored "prefer functional components," it applies when discussing React architecture even if you don't mention "functional" explicitly.

### Sync Across Environments

Memories are linked to your GitHub account and sync automatically:

```
Store in VS Code Chat
  ↓
[GitHub Account Storage]
  ↓
Available in:
  - VS Code on other machines
  - GitHub.com Copilot Chat
  - GitHub CLI (`gh copilot`)
```

This enables consistent assistance regardless of where you work.

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Enabling & Managing -->
## Enabling and Managing Copilot Memory

*Configuration, visibility, and control over stored memories*

### Enabling Memory

**VS Code Configuration:**

Add this single setting to enable the memory tool:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.copilotMemory.enabled": true
}
```

**What happens when enabled:**
- Agent gains access to the memory tool in all chat sessions
- Existing conversations can now store persistent context
- Memory retrieval activates automatically in future sessions

**Multi-environment enablement:**
- **VS Code**: Setting above
- **GitHub.com**: Copilot settings page
- **CLI**: Inherits from GitHub account settings

### Viewing Stored Memories

**GitHub Settings Interface:**

1. Navigate to [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
2. Scroll to "Memory" section
3. See chronological list of all stored memories

**What you'll see:**
```
Memory: "Prefer early returns over nested conditionals. Check failure
        cases first, return early, avoid deep nesting."
Stored: 2026-01-15
Source: VS Code Chat

Memory: "Technical explanations format: one-sentence summary, why it
        matters, code example, common gotchas."
Stored: 2026-01-20
Source: GitHub.com Chat
```

### Managing Memories

**Delete individual memories:**
- Click trash icon next to any memory
- Useful for outdated preferences or project transitions

**Bulk delete:**
- Select multiple with checkboxes
- Click "Delete Selected"
- Efficient for clearing project-specific memories when switching contexts

**Clear all memories:**
- "Clear All" button resets completely
- Use when starting fresh or experimenting with new preferences

**Export memories:**
- Download JSON of all stored memories
- Backup before major changes
- Audit what's been stored

### Memory Lifecycle

Memories have a 28-day automatic expiration to prevent stale information from affecting decisions. This ensures:
- Outdated preferences don't persist indefinitely
- Recent context gets priority
- You're prompted to reconfirm important preferences periodically

**Best practice:** Review stored memories monthly, delete obsolete ones, and refresh important preferences that auto-expired.

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: What to Remember -->
## What to Store in Memory

*Decision criteria for persistence-worthy vs. ephemeral context*

### Ideal Candidates for Memory

These categories provide maximum value when persisted:

**Coding Style Preferences:**
```
✅ "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
✅ "Prefer functional components over class components"
✅ "Use async/await instead of .then() chains"
✅ "Functions should be <20 lines with single responsibility"
✅ "Include JSDoc comments for public APIs"
```

**Workflow Preferences:**
```
✅ "Ask clarifying questions before implementing"
✅ "Show me a plan before making changes"
✅ "Explain reasoning for architectural decisions"
✅ "Always include rollback strategy in implementation plans"
✅ "Estimate time for each step in plans"
```

**Communication Style:**
```
✅ "Be concise — prefer bullet points over paragraphs"
✅ "Include code examples in explanations"
✅ "Always mention tradeoffs for technical decisions"
✅ "Avoid lengthy introductions, get to the point"
✅ "Use one-sentence summary before detailed explanations"
```

**Project Architectural Decisions:**
```
✅ "Our error handling uses a custom Result<T, E> type"
✅ "Database queries go through repository pattern"
✅ "All API responses follow JSON:API specification"
✅ "Use Redis for caching because pub/sub needed for real-time updates (ADR-047)"
```

### What Should NOT Be Stored

**Session-Specific Context:**
```
❌ "Fix the bug on line 47 of this file"
❌ "Refactor the function we discussed earlier"
❌ Current file contents and workspace state
❌ "Let's try approach A first"
```
*Why:* These are ephemeral — relevant only to current task, not future sessions.

**Sensitive Information:**
```
❌ Passwords, API keys, tokens
❌ Personal identifying information (emails, names beyond GitHub identity)
❌ Repository-specific security details
❌ Connection strings with credentials
```
*Why:* Security risk — memory is persistent and synced. Use secret management systems.

**Temporary Debugging Preferences:**
```
❌ "Skip tests for now, we'll add them later"
❌ "Ignore linting errors temporarily"
❌ "Use console.log for debugging this session"
```
*Why:* Bad habits shouldn't persist — these are one-time compromises, not lasting preferences.

**Information That Belongs in Team Instructions:**
```
❌ Team-wide coding standards (everyone must follow)
❌ Mandatory architecture patterns
❌ Compliance and security requirements
```
*Why:* Memory is personal — use custom instructions for team standards.

### The "Persistence Test"

Ask yourself when considering storing something:

1. **Will this apply to multiple future sessions?** (If not, don't store)
2. **Is this a personal preference or team requirement?** (Personal → Memory, Team → Instructions)
3. **Would I explain this to a new teammate?** (If no, probably not memory-worthy)
4. **Is this sensitive or security-related?** (If yes, never store in memory)

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Memory vs Instructions -->
## Memory vs. Custom Instructions

*Complementary features serving different persistence needs*

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Copilot Memory | Custom Instructions |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Scope** | Personal preferences across all projects | Team/project standards within repository |
| **Persistence** | Follows your GitHub account everywhere | Scoped to repository path |
| **Management** | GitHub Settings UI | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file |
| **Sharing** | Individual only, not visible to teammates | Version controlled, team-shared |
| **Best For** | Personal style, communication, workflow | Coding standards, architecture, security patterns |
| **Setup** | One setting toggle | Create markdown file in repo |
| **Visibility** | Private to you | Public to team in version control |

### When to Use Memory

Use memory for preferences that:

- ✅ Follow you across projects (personal coding style)
- ✅ Customize how AI communicates with you (bullet points vs paragraphs)
- ✅ Reflect your individual workflow (planning style, review approach)
- ✅ Don't apply to other team members (they may have different preferences)

**Example memories:**
```
"Prefer early returns over nested conditionals"
"Explain with concise bullet points and code examples"
"Always ask clarifying questions before implementing"
```

### When to Use Custom Instructions

Use custom instructions for standards that:

- ✅ Apply to entire team (everyone must follow)
- ✅ Define project architecture (repository patterns, API format)
- ✅ Specify security requirements (authentication flows, sanitization)
- ✅ Should be version controlled and reviewed (team governance)

**Example instructions:**
```markdown
# .github/copilot-instructions.md

- Use TypeScript strict mode in all files
- Follow Airbnb style guide for JavaScript/TypeScript
- All API responses must follow JSON:API specification
- Error handling uses custom Result<T, E> type (see /lib/result.ts)
- Database queries go through repository pattern (see /lib/db-repository.ts)
```

### Layered Customization Pattern

Memory and instructions work together, not in competition:

```
[Copilot Assistance]
       ↓
  [Step 1: Apply Custom Instructions]
  Team standards: TypeScript strict mode, Airbnb style
       ↓
  [Step 2: Apply Memory]
  Personal preferences: Early returns, concise explanations
       ↓
  [Result: Team consistency + individual customization]
```

**Example scenario:**

**Team instruction (repository):**
```
"Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled"
```

**Your memory (personal):**
```
"Prefer early returns over deeply nested conditionals"
```

**Another teammate's memory (personal):**
```
"Prefer explicit null checks over optional chaining"
```

**Result:** Both developers get TypeScript strict mode (team standard) but with their individual coding style applied on top.

### Decision Flow

```
Q: Who needs to follow this guideline?
├─ Just me → Use Memory
├─ Entire team → Use Custom Instructions
└─ Depends on role/context → Split:
    Team mandate → Instructions
    Personal execution style → Memory
```

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Privacy & Best Practices -->
## Privacy, Security, and Effective Usage

*Understanding data handling and optimizing memory effectiveness*

### Privacy and Security Model

**What Gets Stored:**
- Text summaries of preferences and decisions (e.g., "Prefer early returns")
- Linked to your GitHub account identity
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Stored in GitHub's secure infrastructure (same protection as other GitHub data)

**What NEVER Gets Stored:**
- File contents or code snippets (only preferences about style, not actual code)
- Secrets, API keys, credentials, tokens
- Personal identifying information beyond GitHub account
- Current workspace state or session-specific file paths

**Privacy Boundaries:**
- **Individual privacy**: Memory content is private — not visible to org admins, not in audit logs
- **Enterprise governance**: Organizations can disable memory feature via policy (all-or-nothing)
- **Data portability**: Export memories anytime as JSON for backup or review
- **Right to deletion**: Delete individual memories or clear all with one click

### Enterprise Considerations

**For organizations evaluating Copilot Memory:**

| Concern | How Memory Handles It |
|---------|----------------------|
| "Can admins see employee memories?" | No — memory content is individual-private |
| "What if sensitive data gets stored?" | Memory tool filters secrets; users can delete anything; 28-day auto-expiration |
| "How do we disable for compliance?" | Organization policy can disable memory for all users |
| "Are memories in audit logs?" | No — only usage events (enabled/disabled), not content |

**Governance recommendation:** Enable memory with education about what should/shouldn't be stored. Developers self-police their own memories — same trust model as local notes or browser bookmarks.

### Best Practices for Effective Memory Usage

**Use Explicit Persistence Markers:**

```
✅ Good:
"Remember for future sessions: I prefer concise bullet-point explanations"
"From now on, always ask clarifying questions before implementing"
"In all our conversations, please include code examples"

❌ Vague:
"I like clean code" (what does "clean" mean?)
"Be helpful" (too generic to apply consistently)
"Use best practices" (no specificity)
```

**Be Specific and Actionable:**

```
✅ Specific:
"I prefer functions under 20 lines with single responsibility"
"Use early returns — check failure cases first, avoid deep nesting"
"Technical explanations: 1) summary, 2) why it matters, 3) code example, 4) gotchas"

❌ Vague:
"I like good code"
"Explain things well"
"Make it readable"
```

**Provide Context for Decisions:**

```
✅ With context:
"Use Redis for caching because we need pub/sub for real-time updates (ADR-047)"
"Prefer SQLite for local development — matches production PostgreSQL behavior"

❌ Without context:
"Use Redis" (why? when? always?)
"SQLite is good" (for what purpose?)
```

### Memory Hygiene

**Monthly Review Ritual:**

1. **Audit stored memories** — Review GitHub settings memory list
2. **Delete obsolete preferences** — Remove project-specific memories from old projects
3. **Update evolved conventions** — Refresh memories that have changed
4. **Reconfirm important preferences** — Memory tool auto-expires after 28 days; explicitly re-save critical ones

**Project Transition Checklist:**

- [ ] Clear project-specific architectural decisions when switching projects
- [ ] Keep personal style preferences (coding patterns, communication format)
- [ ] Add new project context as you learn it (don't pre-load, build gradually)

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

- 🛑 **Conflicting memories** — "Prefer verbose explanations" + "Be concise" creates confusion
- 🛑 **Too many memories** — 50+ memories dilutes relevance; curate to most important 10-20
- 🛑 **Vague preferences** — Agent can't apply "write good code" consistently
- 🛑 **Storing team standards in personal memory** — Use custom instructions for team context

### Building Your Memory Profile Progressively

**Week 1: Communication Preferences** (Immediate impact, easy to validate)
```
- Explanation format (bullet points vs paragraphs)
- Verbosity level (concise vs detailed)
- Example style (code examples vs conceptual)
```

**Week 2: Coding Style Preferences** (Personal patterns beyond team standards)
```
- Function length preferences
- Conditional structure (early returns vs nested)
- Comment style (when and how)
```

**Week 3: Workflow Preferences** (How you work, not what you build)
```
- Planning style (detailed upfront vs iterative)
- Review approach (what you want called out)
- Debugging methodology (logging vs debugging vs tests)
```

**Week 4: Project Context** (Architectural decisions and rationale)
```
- Key technology choices and why
- Historical context ("we tried X, it failed because Y")
- ADR references for important decisions
```

**Outcome:** After 4 weeks, a curated 10-15 memory collection provides consistent, personalized assistance without overwhelming the context retrieval system.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Eliminating Style Re-Explanation

**The Problem:** A developer prefers early returns and concise bullet-point explanations. Every session starts with 5-10 minutes re-explaining these preferences because the AI defaults to nested conditionals and verbose paragraphs.

**The Solution:** Store two memories:
```
"I prefer early returns over nested conditionals. Check failure cases
 first and return early rather than nesting success paths."

"When explaining technical concepts, use bullet points with code
 examples. Skip lengthy introductions."
```

**Outcome:**
- **Before:** 10 minutes per session × 3 sessions per day × 5 days = 150 minutes/week wasted
- **After:** 5 minutes one-time storage, preferences apply automatically in all sessions
- **Time saved:** 145 minutes/week = 12.5 hours/month = 150 hours/year per developer

---

### Use Case 2: Architectural Decision Persistence

**The Problem:** A team chose Redis for caching because pub/sub was needed for real-time updates (documented in ADR-047). AI suggestions kept recommending Memcached because it didn't have this context, requiring correction every time caching came up.

**The Solution:** Store architectural decision with rationale:
```
"Use Redis for caching, not Memcached. Requirement: pub/sub for
 real-time updates (ADR-047 after WebSocket migration)."
```

**Outcome:**
- **Before:** AI suggested Memcached → developer corrected → AI apologized → suggested Redis → explained why — 15 minutes per occurrence, happened monthly
- **After:** AI references Redis automatically with correct justification, no correction needed
- **Consistency:** Architectural decisions persist across sessions, new team members get context automatically

---

### Use Case 3: Communication Format Optimization

**The Problem:** A developer needs quick, actionable answers but AI defaulted to lengthy explanations. Adjusting response format manually every time wasted cognitive effort and broke flow.

**The Solution:** Store communication preference:
```
"Be concise. Use format: 1) one-sentence summary, 2) why it matters,
 3) code example, 4) common gotchas. Skip introductions."
```

**Outcome:**
- **Before:** 40-60 responses per week required manual "make this shorter" follow-ups
- **After:** Responses arrive in preferred format automatically — zero follow-ups needed
- **Efficiency:** Information delivered in cognitive style developer processes best — no format translation overhead

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes

### Memory Tool Implementation

The memory tool is implemented as an agent-accessible capability with semantic retrieval:

**Storage Pipeline:**
```
User input
  → Agent analyzes for persistence-worthiness
  → Memory tool evaluates criteria (sensitive? ephemeral? team vs personal?)
  → If appropriate, stores with metadata (timestamp, source, category)
  → Encrypted and synced to GitHub account storage
  → 28-day expiration timer starts
```

**Retrieval Pipeline:**
```
New chat session starts
  → Agent analyzes conversation context and intent
  → Memory tool performs semantic search ("authentication" query retrieves OAuth, security, token management memories)
  → Ranked by relevance (not chronological — most relevant first)
  → Top 3-5 memories added to context window

**Why Semantic, Not Keyword:** If you store "prefer functional components," it applies when discussing React architecture even if you don't say "functional" — the tool understands conceptual relationships.

### Auto-Expiration Rationale

Memories expire after 28 days to prevent stale preferences from persisting indefinitely. This design choice balances:

- **Freshness:** Preferences evolve — what you wanted 3 months ago may not apply today
- **Validation:** Forces periodic review — important preferences get explicitly reconfirmed
- **Context quality:** Recent memories correlate with current projects and priorities

**Best practice:** When memory expires, decide: still relevant? Re-save explicitly. No longer applies? Let it expire. Creates a natural curation cycle.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Memory content is isolated from organization visibility by design:

| Data | Visibility |
|------|-----------|
| Memory content text | Individual only |
| Memory existence count | Individual only |
| Memory enabled/disabled status | Organization can see |
| Memory usage events (stored/retrieved) | Audit logs (metadata only, no content) |

This enables **personal productivity without surveillance** — organizations can govern policy (memory on/off) but can't inspect individual content.

**Why it matters:** Developers customize without fear of judgment — preferences like "explain slowly, I'm learning" or "skip testing temporarily" remain private while still providing productivity benefits.
