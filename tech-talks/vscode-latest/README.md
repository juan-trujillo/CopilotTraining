## 🧠 The Shift

> **The Core Insight:** From **one AI assistant you converse with** to **a team of specialized AI agents you orchestrate across local, background, cloud, and Claude sessions**

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Agent Sessions & Orchestration -->
## Agent Sessions & Orchestration

The biggest evolution across these three releases is how VS Code manages multiple agent sessions. What started as a single Chat view conversation is now a unified multi-agent platform [^6].

### Agent Sessions in the Chat View (v1.107)

Agent sessions are now integrated directly into the Chat view [^3]:

- **Compact mode** — Shows the three most recent sessions when Chat view is narrow
- **Side-by-side mode** — Full session list with search and filters when Chat view is wide
- **Status indicators** — In-progress, unread, needs attention (visible in the VS Code command center)

```json
// Control orientation
"chat.viewSessions.orientation": "sideBySide"  // or "stacked", "auto"
```

### Switching and Delegating Between Agent Types (v1.107 → v1.109)

VS Code now supports four agent types optimized for different workflows [^1] [^3]:

| Agent Type | Best For | Key Trait |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Local** | Interactive planning, exploration | Real-time in Chat view |
| **Background** | Autonomous multi-file tasks | Runs in isolated Git worktree |
| **Cloud** | Cross-repo operations at scale | GitHub-hosted infrastructure |
| **Claude** | Complex reasoning, architecture | Anthropic SDK with thinking tokens |

The session type picker lets you start in one mode and hand off to another — plan locally, then click **Continue in → Background** to let the agent implement autonomously while you continue working [^1].

### Background Agents with Git Worktree Isolation (v1.107)

Background agents can now run in dedicated Git worktrees, preventing conflicts with your active workspace [^3]:

- Agent creates a new worktree automatically for the session
- Changes are committed per turn to the worktree — your main workspace is untouched
- Review via diff view when the agent completes; apply all, cherry-pick, or discard
- Multiple background agents can run simultaneously in separate worktrees

```json
// Copy extra files into worktrees (e.g., git-ignored config)
"git.worktreeIncludeFiles": ["config/local.json", ".env.local"]
```

### Parallel Subagents (v1.107 → v1.109)

Agents can now delegate subtasks to **subagents** that operate in their own context windows [^1] [^3]. In v1.109, subagents run in parallel, significantly speeding up tasks that can be split into independent parts. A dedicated **search subagent** iteratively refines codebase searches without consuming the main agent's context window [^1].

### Agent Sessions Welcome Page (v1.109)

A new experimental welcome page surfaces your agent sessions front and center when you open VS Code [^1]:

```json
"workbench.startupEditor": "agentSessionsWelcomePage"
```

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Agent Customization -->
## Agent Customization

### Agent Skills — From Experimental to GA (v1.107 → v1.109)

Agent Skills package domain expertise into reusable folders that agents load on-demand. Skills went from experimental in v1.108 to **generally available and enabled by default** in v1.109 [^1] [^2]:

```
.github/skills/
  api-design/
    SKILL.md          # Instructions, templates, validation
  security-review/
    SKILL.md
```

Each `SKILL.md` has a description in its frontmatter — agents match skills to tasks automatically.

```json
// Skills are enabled by default in v1.109
"chat.useAgentSkills": true,

// Add custom skill locations
"chat.agentSkillsLocations": {
  "~/.copilot/skills": true,
  "shared/team-skills": true
}
```

Extension authors can also package skills using the `chatSkills` contribution point [^1].

### Custom Agent Controls (v1.109)

Custom agents (`.agent.md` files) gained powerful new attributes [^1]:

- **`user-invokable: false`** — Create agents accessible only as subagents, not from the agents dropdown
- **`disable-model-invocation`** — Prevent an agent from being invoked automatically by other agents
- **`agents: ['Modify', 'Search']`** — Restrict which subagents a given agent can invoke
- **Multiple model support** — Specify fallback models in order of preference

```markdown
---
name: architect
model: ['Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)', 'GPT-5 (copilot)']
tools: ['readFiles', 'codeSearch', 'agent']
agents: ['Modify', 'Search']
user-invokable: true
---

You are an experienced software architect...
```

### Organization-Wide Instructions (v1.107 → v1.109)

**Org-level custom agents** (v1.107) and **org-level custom instructions** (v1.109) let GitHub organizations enforce consistent AI guidance across all developers [^1] [^3]:

```json
// Enabled by default in v1.109
"github.copilot.chat.organizationInstructions.enabled": true
```

### `/init` — Bootstrap Your Workspace for AI (v1.109)

The new `/init` slash command analyzes your project structure and generates a tailored `copilot-instructions.md` or `AGENTS.md` file automatically [^1].

### Chat Customization Diagnostics (v1.109)

A new diagnostics view (right-click in Chat → **Diagnostics**) shows all currently loaded custom agents, prompt files, instructions, and skills, along with any loading errors [^1].

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Claude & Anthropic Integration -->
## Claude & Anthropic Integration

### Claude Agent (Preview, v1.109)

VS Code now supports the **Claude Agent SDK** directly — delegate tasks using the Anthropic agent harness with models from your GitHub Copilot subscription [^1] [^5]. Claude Agent appears as a session type alongside Local, Background, and Cloud.

### Thinking Tokens (v1.107 → v1.109)

Anthropic models now show **thinking tokens** — visible reasoning that shows hypothesis formation, tool selection, and error recovery in real-time [^1] [^7]:

```json
// Configure extended thinking budget (default: 4000, set 0 to disable)
"github.copilot.chat.anthropic.thinking.budgetTokens": 10000,

// Choose detailed or compact thinking style
"chat.thinking.style": "detailed",

// Collapse tool sections to reduce noise
"chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools": ["terminal", "search"],

// Auto-expand failing tool calls
"chat.tools.autoExpandFailures": true
```

In v1.109, the Messages API with **interleaved thinking** enables Claude to reason between tool calls, providing more contextual multi-step responses [^1].

### Additional Anthropic Features (v1.109)

- **Tool search tool** — Helps Claude discover the most relevant tools from a large pool [^1]
- **Context editing (Experimental)** — Clears tool results and thinking tokens from previous turns to maintain more context [^1]

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Security & Trust -->
## Security & Trust

### Terminal Sandboxing (Experimental, v1.109)

OS-level sandboxing restricts agent-executed terminal commands [^1]:

- **File system**: Read/write only within the workspace directory
- **Network**: Blocked by default; specific domains can be allowlisted
- **Supported on**: macOS (`sandbox-exec`) and Linux (Landlock/seccomp)

```json
{
  "chat.tools.terminal.sandbox.enabled": true,
  "chat.tools.terminal.sandbox.network": ["github.com", "npmjs.com"]
}
```

When sandboxing is enabled, commands run without the standard confirmation dialog because they operate in a controlled environment [^1].

### Terminal Auto-Approval Rules (v1.107 → v1.109)

Auto-approval has expanded progressively across releases [^1] [^2] [^3]:

| Release | New Auto-Approved Commands |
|---------|---------------------------|
| v1.107 | "Allow all commands in this session" option added |
| v1.108 | `git ls-files`, `rg`, `sed`, workspace npm scripts via `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` |
| v1.109 | `Set-Location`, `dir`, `docker` (safe sub-commands), `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm` (safe sub-commands) |

```json
"chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove": true,
"chat.tools.terminal.autoApproveWorkspaceNpmScripts": true
```

### Terminal Tool Improvements (v1.109)

- **Richer command details** — Inline syntax highlighting for Python/Node/Ruby, working directory display, command intent description on hover [^1]
- **Output streaming** — Long-running commands auto-expand to show progress; quick commands stay collapsed [^1]
- **Interactive input** — Embedded terminals support direct typing for confirmation prompts [^1]
- **Timeout property** — Required on all terminal tool calls; prevents hung processes [^1]
- **Background management** — New `awaitTerminal` and `killTerminal` tools for proper lifecycle control [^1]
- **No shell history** — Agent-executed commands no longer appear in shell history (v1.108) [^2]

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Chat UX & Productivity -->
## Chat UX & Productivity

### Mermaid Diagrams in Chat (v1.109)

Chat responses can now render interactive Mermaid diagrams — flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more. Pan, zoom, and open in a full-sized editor [^1].

### Ask Questions Tool (Experimental, v1.109)

Instead of making assumptions, the agent can present clarifying questions with single/multi-select options, free text, and recommended answers. The **Plan agent** now uses this in a structured 4-phase workflow: Discovery → Alignment → Design → Refinement [^1].

### Context Window Details (v1.109)

A new context window indicator in the chat input area shows a breakdown of token usage by category on hover — see exactly how the model is using its context budget [^1].

### Copilot Memory (Preview, v1.109)

Persistent context across sessions — the agent can store and recall important information like preferences, conventions, and project context [^1]:

```json
"github.copilot.chat.copilotMemory.enabled": true
```

### Integrated Browser (Preview, v1.109)

A full integrated browser replaces the limited Simple Browser. Sign into websites, use DevTools, send elements to chat for AI assistance [^1]:

```json
"workbench.browser.openLocalhostLinks": true,
"simpleBrowser.useIntegratedBrowser": true
```

### MCP Apps (v1.109)

MCP servers can now display rich interactive UI in the client — flame graphs, custom visualizations, and more [^1].

### External Indexing for Non-GitHub Workspaces (v1.109)

Workspaces not hosted on GitHub can now be remotely indexed for fast semantic search (`#codebase`), providing the same code search experience as GitHub-hosted repos [^1].

### Language Models Editor (v1.107 → v1.109)

A centralized editor for managing all language models — toggle visibility, add providers, configure API keys, manage multiple configurations per provider [^1] [^3]. Model configurations are now stored in a dedicated `chatLanguageModels.json` file.

### Inline Chat UX Revamp (v1.107 → v1.109)

Inline chat is now optimized for quick single-file code changes, with a new affordance for triggering and a lightweight contextual rendering mode [^1] [^3].

## 🧠 Mental Model Shift

> **The Core Insight:** From **one AI assistant you converse with** to **a team of specialized AI agents you orchestrate**

### Move Toward ✅

- ✅ **Multi-session workflows**: Plan locally → implement in background → review worktree diff → merge selectively
- ✅ **Domain-specific Skills**: Capture team expertise once in `SKILL.md` files; agents apply it automatically
- ✅ **Visible reasoning**: Enable thinking tokens on complex tasks to see hypotheses, tool choices, and error recovery
- ✅ **Sandboxed autonomy**: Auto-approve safe commands while sandboxing blocks system access
- ✅ **Organization consistency**: Org-level agents and instructions enforce standards across teams

### Move Away From ⚠️

- ⚠️ **Single long conversations**: Context overflow degrades quality; use subagents and session handoffs instead
- ⚠️ **Manual approval fatigue**: Configure auto-approval rules and sandboxing instead of clicking "allow" 50 times
- ⚠️ **Per-developer customization**: Org-level customization replaces individual `copilot-instructions.md` divergence

### Move Against 🛑

- 🛑 **Unsandboxed autonomous agents**: Never run background agents with unrestricted system and network access
- 🛑 **Context dumping**: Never paste an entire codebase into one conversation — use `#codebase`, subagents, and targeted context

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes

### The Copilot Extension Unification

In v1.107, inline suggestions began being served from the GitHub Copilot **Chat** extension. By v1.109, the original GitHub Copilot extension was **fully deprecated** and auto-uninstalled on update [^1]. All AI functionality now lives in a single extension: GitHub Copilot Chat.

### Engineering Highlights

- **v1.108 Housekeeping**: The VS Code team closed **5,951 issues** across all repositories, including 2,872 in the core `microsoft/vscode` repo and 1,659 in `microsoft/vscode-copilot-release` [^2]
- **Build scripts in TypeScript**: VS Code now runs build scripts directly as TypeScript (Node 22.18+), deleting ~15,000 lines of compiled JS [^3]
- **macOS DMG installer**: VS Code ships DMG images for native drag-and-drop installation [^1]
- **Windows 11 context menu**: Right-click in File Explorer now shows VS Code in the top-level context menu [^1]
