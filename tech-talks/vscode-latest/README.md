# VS Code Copilot Through 1.139: Agent Infrastructure, Open Models, and Closed-Loop Delivery

> **The Question This Talk Answers:**
> *"How does VS Code's Copilot platform evolve from a single-window conversation partner into portable agent infrastructure with open model choice and a closed review loop — and which capabilities are ready for our teams today?"*

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes | **Target Audience:** Developers using AI-assisted workflows in VS Code

---

## 📊 Content Fitness

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Relevant** | 🟢 High | Releases through 1.139 change where agents run, which models they use, and how review happens. Teams can choose an execution environment that matches their project. |
| **Compelling** | 🟢 High | The open-model story (BYOK with no GitHub sign-in) and the Agents window parallel-work model are architectural shifts, not incremental additions. |
| **Actionable** | 🟢 High | GA browser tools, Stable Custom Endpoint, and BYOK are available today. Parallel sessions and remote hosts are preview but explorable now. |

**Overall Status:** 🟢 Ready to use

---

## The Opportunity

### What's Now Possible

- **Portable agent infrastructure** — The Copilot SDK and Agent Host Protocol (AHP) let agent sessions run on owned remote machines and survive the originating VS Code window closing.
- **Open model choice** — Supported BYOK providers, local Ollama models, and compatible custom endpoints work in chat, tools, and MCP without a GitHub sign-in. Signed-out access to the separate Agents window has additional experimental settings.[^12]
- **Agents window as the agent surface** — A dedicated VS Code window for agent-first work across workspaces; multi-session, multi-chat, peer forks, and live activity pills once people actually open it.
- **Closed-loop delivery** — GA browser tools, Copilot Vision paste, in-window diff review, element-specific comments, and CI/PR feedback responses close the build-validate-review cycle without leaving the agent session.

### The Emerging Practice

The central question the releases through VS Code 1.139 answer is how agentic development infrastructure matures. The Agent Host Protocol and Copilot SDK remove the coupling between one VS Code window and one live agent session. A remote session can persist when its client disconnects, and the agent host can synchronize the same session across multiple VS Code windows. This changes what "starting an agent" means: it can be a durable unit of work running on infrastructure our teams own. A Dev Container can now supply the project toolchain for a local or remote agent session, subject to rollout and host prerequisites.[^13][^14]

Model choice and economics follow from the same logic. When a compatible endpoint works — including local Ollama models and provider API keys without GitHub sign-in for chat — the model picker becomes infrastructure configuration rather than a subscription-tier boundary. The 1M-token context windows available on supported models become a practical architectural decision for large-codebase tasks. Two boundaries matter for a signed-out workflow: inline suggestions and next-edit suggestions (NES) still require GitHub sign-in, and signed-out use of the desktop Agents window is experimental rather than the default setup.[^12]

Parallel work and closed-loop review make this practical at scale — but only if people open the surface built for it. Many developers still run agents only from the side Chat view and never discover the **Agents window**: a dedicated VS Code window optimized for agent-first work across workspaces. Once that window is open, multiple sessions side-by-side, `/btw` side chats, and live activity pills make concurrent effort legible. When those efforts touch the browser or produce PRs, the review workflow stays in-session — device-emulated screenshots, element comments, inline diff review, and CI/PR response all resolve without context switching. Everyday context handoff got easier too: **Copilot Vision** is GA, so pasted images and PDFs attach as multimodal context instead of forcing a wall of text into the prompt.

---

## How It Works: The Four Pillars

| Pillar | What Changed | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent Infrastructure** | AHP + Copilot SDK: sessions persist beyond the originating window; run on owned remote hosts | Preview |
| **Open Model Workbench** | BYOK chat without GitHub sign-in; Stable Custom Endpoint; Ollama; 1M-token contexts | GA for BYOK chat; signed-out Agents window experimental |
| **Parallel Agent Work** | Agents window as the primary surface; multi-session, multi-chat, peer forks, `/btw`, live pills | Preview (Agents window) |
| **Closed-Loop Delivery** | GA browser tools, Copilot Vision paste, element comments, in-window review, CI/PR feedback | GA + Preview mix |

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Agent Infrastructure -->
## Agent Infrastructure: Remote Hosts and a Portable Harness

The infrastructure story in VS Code 1.121 centers on two components: the **Agent Host Protocol (AHP)** and the **Copilot SDK**. Together they make the agent harness portable — decoupled from a specific VS Code window and capable of running on infrastructure our teams own.[^1]

### The Agent Host Protocol

AHP is an open protocol for coordinating agent sessions across multiple clients. An agent host owns authoritative session state, synchronizes it to connected clients, and sequences mutations. Because the specification is open, other clients and hosts can implement the protocol.

In practice, the Agents window can connect through SSH or a dev tunnel to a remote machine, start a long-lived agent host there, and reconnect after the client disconnects. VS Code 1.132 extends the model by allowing the same agent session to be connected from multiple VS Code windows.[^1][^5]

### Remote Machine Execution

The remote agent host runs as a separate process on an owned machine reachable through SSH or a VS Code dev tunnel:

1. Open the Agents window.
2. Open its remote tab and connect with an existing `~/.ssh/config` entry, a `user@host` value, or a running dev tunnel.
3. VS Code installs or connects to its CLI server and starts the agent host on that machine.

The host persists after the VS Code window closes. Progress, tool outputs, and session memory remain accessible on reconnect.

If the repository has a supported Dev Container configuration, the developer can select **Use Dev Container** from the remote folder menu so the agent builds and tests with the project's dependencies. VS Code 1.138 introduced this for local folders; 1.139 extends it to SSH, Tunnel, and WSL hosts. Enable `chat.agentHost.devContainer.enabled`, confirm Docker is available **on the remote host**, then start a small test session and inspect its toolchain before delegating a migration. Availability is rolling out gradually, so prepare a standard remote-host path if the menu is absent.[^13][^14]

> **Preview boundary:** Remote agents and parts of the AHP rollout remain preview. Host registration and session migration UX continue to evolve; Dev Container sessions are on a gradual rollout and may need the setting enabled manually.[^1][^14]

### Copilot SDK and Harness Portability

The Copilot SDK is the runtime that agent harnesses are built on. The SDK abstraction means:

- The agent host can run Copilot, Claude, and Codex harnesses in a dedicated process
- The Copilot harness uses the Copilot SDK, aligning behavior with Copilot CLI and the standalone Copilot app
- Clients and hosts can coordinate through the open AHP specification

This separates the session-management protocol from the harness that performs the coding work.[^1][^5]

### Decision: Local vs. Remote Agent Execution

```
Q: Where does the agent work need to run?
├─ Work is interactive and exploratory
│  └─ Local session in the Agents window → full UX, real-time steering
│
├─ Work is long-running and autonomous (> 30 min, multi-file)
│  └─ Remote host with Autopilot → session persists, reconnect on completion
│
├─ Work needs CI environment or production secrets
│  └─ Remote host with approved access → inspect toolchain and permission boundaries
│
├─ Work needs the repo's development dependencies
│  └─ Dev Container on local or remote host → verify Docker, configuration, rollout
│
└─ Work is blocked on an interactive terminal or browser
   └─ Local session with GA browser tools → closed-loop review stays in-window
```

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Open Model Workbench -->
## Open Model Workbench: BYOK Chat Without GitHub Sign-In

VS Code 1.122 makes the most consequential model-flexibility change yet: using Anthropic, Azure, Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, or any compatible custom endpoint no longer requires a GitHub account. Chat, tool execution, and MCP operate against whatever model is configured.[^2]

### BYOK Without GitHub Sign-In (GA)

Any VS Code user can configure a provider key in the model picker — no GitHub sign-in, no Copilot subscription required for the connected model.

**To add a provider:**
1. Open the model picker (chat input area, model name dropdown)
2. Select **Manage Models…**
3. Choose a provider (Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter) or **Custom**
4. Enter the API key and select models to expose in the picker

Billing and rate limits go through the provider — Copilot quotas don't apply to BYOK sessions.[^2]

> **Two sign-in boundaries:** Inline suggestions (ghost-text completions while typing) and next-edit suggestions (NES) still require GitHub sign-in and a Copilot subscription. BYOK works for chat, tools, and MCP without that sign-in, but the separate **desktop Agents window** requires GitHub authentication by default. Signed-out use there is experimental: enable `chat.agentHost.allowSignedOutWhenUsable` with a usable provider, and `chat.agentHost.byokModels.enabled` for visible BYOK models in Agent Host sessions. The browser-based Agents window always requires GitHub sign-in.[^2][^12]

### Local Models via Ollama

Ollama is a first-class supported provider. After installing Ollama and pulling a model locally, add it via the model picker:

1. Select **Manage Models…** → **Ollama**
2. VS Code discovers locally available Ollama models automatically
3. Select which models to expose in the picker

Local models work with all chat features, tool execution, and MCP — no network request leaves the machine. This matters for teams with air-gap requirements or sensitive codebases where data residency is constrained.

```bash
# Pull models locally before adding them to VS Code
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull codestral
```

### Stable Custom Endpoint

The **Custom Endpoint** provider is available in Stable as of v1.122. It connects endpoints that implement the Chat Completions, Responses, or Messages API families.

Configure it through **Chat: Manage Language Models**: add **Custom Endpoint**, choose the endpoint's API family, then provide the endpoint and model details requested by the editor.[^2]

Teams running internal model gateways — for cost control, logging, or compliance — can route all VS Code Copilot chat traffic through them without any client-side code changes.[^2]

### Utility Models

Utility models handle background chat tasks such as titles, summaries, commit messages, rename suggestions, prompt categorization, and intent detection. They are independently configurable, making it practical to reserve a frontier model for primary work while a faster local or lower-cost model handles utility flows.

```json
{
  "chat.utilityModel": "[configured-model-id]",
  "chat.utilitySmallModel": "[configured-fast-model-id]"
}
```

### 1M-Token Contexts

Models with 1M-token context support can be used for large-codebase tasks that previously required careful context management. When a supported model is selected, VS Code exposes the full context window. The context indicator in the chat input area shows token usage breakdown on hover.

Practical note: very long contexts increase latency and provider cost. The `/compact` command and background compaction remain available as cost-quality tradeoffs for models that perform better with focused contexts.[^2]

### Model Selection Decision Guide

If the Copilot model picker exposes **efficiency**, **balance**, and **intelligence** auto-selection tiers, treat them as a rolling-out cost/quality/latency choice over the same available Copilot models, not as three new BYOK providers.[^15]

```
Q: What will the model do in this session?
├─ Interactive chat and planning
│  └─ Currently supported frontier model via Copilot or BYOK
│
├─ Long-context codebase analysis (> 200k tokens)
│  └─ BYOK provider with 1M-token model + direct API access
│
├─ High-volume agent sub-tasks (search, retrieval, summarization)
│  └─ Utility model (Ollama local, or low-cost API endpoint)
│
├─ Sensitive codebase or air-gap requirement
│  └─ Ollama local model — no data leaves the machine
│
└─ Inline completions (ghost text, NES)
   └─ GitHub sign-in + Copilot subscription required — no BYOK path
```

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Parallel Agent Work -->
## Parallel Agent Work: Open the Agents Window First

The highest-leverage feature many teams still skip is not a model or a tool — it is a **window**. The side Chat view is fine for code-adjacent questions. The **Agents window** is the surface built for agent-first work: start and monitor sessions across workspaces, review changes beside the conversation, and run concurrent efforts without burying them in one editor sidebar.[^6]

### Open It (Awareness Before Features)

If the audience takes nothing else from this section, take this: open the Agents window once and keep it available.

| How | Action |
|---|---|
| Title bar | Select **Open in Agents** |
| Command Palette | **Chat: Open Agents Window** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `⇧⌘P`) |
| CLI | `code --agents` |
| Welcome | **Try out the new Agents window** on the VS Code welcome page |
| Browser | [insiders.vscode.dev/agents](https://insiders.vscode.dev/agents) for Agents-window-from-any-device setups |

The Agents window opens as a **dedicated VS Code window** alongside the main editor. Both surfaces share the same sessions, settings, and keybindings — moving between code-first and agent-first work does not fork context.[^6]

What you get that the side Chat view does not emphasize:

- **Sessions list** across workspaces (local folders, GitHub repos, SSH / dev-tunnel remotes), grouped by workspace by default
- **Chat + Changes + Files** for the active session in one place
- **Customizations panel** for agents, skills, and related workflow setup
- **Multi-session orchestration** without opening a separate editor window per project

> **Preview boundary:** The Agents window remains public preview. Host registration, cross-host session management, and some multi-chat behaviors continue to evolve. Treat it as the recommended agent surface to explore now, not as a frozen production control plane.[^6]

### Multiple Sessions Side-by-Side

Once the window is open, the payoff is concurrent work with isolation. Multiple active sessions can run simultaneously, each with its own worktree, tool context, and model configuration. Sessions can be grouped, reordered, and filtered. Common patterns:

- Run a **spec-writing session** and a **test-generation session** simultaneously for the same feature
- Keep a **long-running refactoring session** in the background while working interactively on a different module
- Route different harnesses to different sessions: one using a local Ollama model for exploration, another using a frontier model for generation

Worktrees are automatically managed per session. Each session's changes stay isolated until reviewed and merged.[^4]

### Multiple Chats Per Session and Peer Forks

Within a single agent session, the Agents window supports multiple chat threads. This is useful for:

- **Branching exploration** — start from the same point and explore two approaches in parallel without losing either
- **Peer review conversations** — keep a review discussion separate from the implementation conversation, both referencing the same session state

**Peer-chat forks** create a new chat from any point in an existing conversation. The fork shares the session's worktree and tool state, so both chats have access to the same files without duplicating setup.[^4]

### Worktrees Across Harnesses

The worktree isolation model now works across harnesses. Whether a session is running on the local VS Code harness, a remote host, or the Copilot SDK harness, changes go into an isolated Git worktree. This means:

- Background sessions started before a remote-host rollout continue to work the same way
- Teams mixing local and remote execution don't need per-harness worktree configuration
- The review-and-merge workflow — review diffs inline, apply all, cherry-pick, or discard — is consistent regardless of where the session ran[^4]

### /btw: Contextual Side Chat Without Interrupting a Turn

The `/btw` command (v1.132) opens a side chat that runs alongside the active agent turn without pausing or interrupting it.[^5]

```
/btw should we use the builder pattern here instead?
```

Use cases:
- Ask a clarifying question while an agent is executing a long tool chain
- Capture an observation for later action without stopping the current turn
- Route a subagent inquiry to a different thread so the main conversation stays clean

The side chat shares the primary chat's context and prompt cache. Responses appear separately while the main turn continues.[^5]

### Live Activity Pills

Live pills in the Agents window surface what is happening inside a running session at a glance. Pills expose:[^5]

- **Changes** — files modified so far in the current turn
- **Previews** — Markdown previews for files the agent creates or edits
- **Subagents** — active child conversations with direct navigation
- **Browsers** — direct access to the integrated browser activity for the session

For sessions running Autopilot, live pills replace the need to manually poll session state. The pills clear when a turn completes, so the session view doesn't accumulate noise from previous work.

### Preview Status and Practical Limits

> The Agents window remains public preview. Session migration across hosts, peer-fork merge conflict resolution, and group-level settings are still evolving. For production-critical workflows, treat the Agents window as high-capability preview rather than a stable production substrate.

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Closed-Loop Delivery -->
## Closed-Loop Delivery: Build, Validate, and Review Without Leaving the Session

VS Code 1.123–1.132 closes the feedback loop: browser validation, code review, CI response, and PR comment handling all happen inside the Agents window session that did the work.[^3][^4][^5]

### GA Agentic Browser Tools

Agentic browser tools are generally available and enabled by default as of the June 2026 release. No configuration flag is required.[^3]

Built-in browser tool capabilities:

- **Navigation**: `openBrowserPage`, `navigatePage`
- **Inspection**: `readPage`, `screenshotPage`
- **Interaction**: click, hover, type, handle dialogs, and drag page elements
- **Automation**: run Playwright sequences for custom validation
- **Device emulation**: specify viewport, user-agent, and device preset in tool calls
- **Remote browsing**: connect to a browser on a remote host running the agent session

Pages opened by agents run in private, in-memory sessions. Tabs must be explicitly shared to give an agent access to an existing browser session.

```json
// Browser tools are GA and on by default.
// Re-enable if policy-disabled:
"workbench.browser.enableChatTools": true
```

### Device Emulation and Screenshots

Device emulation lets agents validate responsive layouts and mobile-specific behavior without leaving VS Code. An agent can:

1. Open a localhost page in the integrated browser
2. Emulate a specific device (iPhone 15, Galaxy S24, iPad) or custom viewport
3. Take a screenshot
4. Comment on the result or adjust CSS and re-validate

Screenshots are attached directly to the chat turn that produced them, making the validation evidence part of the conversation record.[^3]

### Copilot Vision: Paste Evidence Instead of Walls of Text

Copilot Vision is generally available as of VS Code 1.128. Attach images and PDFs to Chat by pasting, dragging and dropping, or using the context menu — in ask, plan, and agent modes. Vision is available on Free, Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise Copilot plans with no admin opt-in required.[^7][^8]

Practical pattern: stop dumping huge tabular or visual context as plain text. Copy a range from Excel (or any app that places image data on the clipboard), paste into Chat, and VS Code attaches it as an image for the model to read. The same path works for UI mockups, error dialogs, whiteboard photos, and PDFs. That is usually faster and more faithful than pasting thousands of cells or re-describing a layout in prose.

From the integrated browser toolbar you can also push page context into the prompt without leaving VS Code:[^9]

- **Add Screenshot to Chat** — capture the current viewport as an image attachment
- **Add Element to Chat** — include selected elements with styles and screenshots
- **Add Console Logs to Chat** — attach runtime output for debugging

Use agent browser tools when the agent should drive the page. Use Vision paste / Add-to-Chat when **you** already have the evidence and want the model to reason about it on the next turn.

### Element-Specific Comments (v1.132)

Developers can select one or more elements in the integrated browser, attach a comment to each, and send that precise visual feedback to the agent.[^5]

Practical use: after an agent implements a UI component, the reviewer selects the elements that still need attention and anchors a separate instruction to each before sending the feedback.

### In-Window Code and Diff Review

Files and diffs created by an agent session are reviewable inside the Agents window without switching to the main editor. The review panel shows:[^4]

- All files modified in the current session
- A per-file diff view with options to apply, revert, or cherry-pick changes
- Inline commenting on any line — comments are actionable by the agent in subsequent turns

This replaces the earlier pattern of reviewing changes in the worktree diff and then returning to chat to request adjustments. The review and the conversation are the same surface.

### Markdown Editing with Agent-Actionable Comments

For Markdown files, the session supports hybrid editing: the developer edits Markdown directly alongside the agent's proposed content, and comments left by the developer become instructions the agent acts on in its next turn.[^4]

> **Experimental:** Hybrid Markdown editing is experimental through v1.132. Enable via the Agents window session settings. Behavior may change before GA.

### CI and PR Feedback Response

Before CI can run, the developer can create a pull request from an Agent Host session in the Agents window: review the generated title and description, choose draft status, then create it directly or ask the agent to do so. **Agent Merge** is a separate experimental option behind `chat.agentMerge.enabled`; check which controls the installed build exposes before using it in a live demo.[^13]

When a session's changes are pushed to a branch and CI runs, the Agents window surfaces failed check details directly in the session view. The agent can then:[^4]

- Read the failure details (test output, lint errors, type errors)
- Propose and apply fixes
- Re-run relevant checks to confirm resolution

Pull request review comments that arrive on the branch are surfaced in the session. The agent can respond to each comment, apply the requested change, or mark the comment as addressed — all from within the Agents window. This closes the last gap in the build-review-merge cycle.

---

## Boundaries and Control

Enterprise controls in the June 2026 release complement the open model and parallel work capabilities with visibility and governance.[^3]

**Session cost visibility:** The Agents window shows credit usage per session and per subagent turn. Model costs are visible when using BYOK providers. Teams can monitor spend without leaving the development context.

**OpenTelemetry signals:** Richer OTel trace data from agent sessions integrates with existing observability platforms. Tool call latency, turn count, and subagent depth are exported as structured spans.

**Managed settings:** Organizations can enforce baseline VS Code Copilot settings through managed configuration, preventing individuals from overriding security-relevant defaults (sandbox settings, terminal approval behavior, sensitive prompt handling).

**Signed-out agent-host access:** BYOK chat without GitHub sign-in does not automatically unlock the Agents window. The desktop signed-out path is experimental and setting-gated; browser access still requires GitHub sign-in. Verify the planned demo's account and model path before presenting.[^12]

**MCP allowlists:** Enterprise MCP allowlists let organizations centrally control which MCP server endpoints agent sessions can connect to. Team-scoped allowlists appear in the Agents window session settings.

**Sensitive terminal prompts:** Password, passphrase, PIN, and verification-code prompts are intercepted. With default approvals, VS Code directs the developer to enter the value in the terminal; in auto-approve flows, it cancels the command and tells the model not to retry or request the secret.[^1]

```json
// Key settings for security-aware deployments
{
  "chat.agent.sandbox.enabled": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.organizationInstructions.enabled": true,
  "workbench.browser.enableChatTools": true
}
```

> Some controls depend on Copilot plan (Business or Enterprise) and organization policy. Individual plans have access to session cost visibility but not managed settings or MCP allowlists.

---

## 🎯 Mental Model Shift

> **The Core Insight:** Copilot in VS Code has moved from **a conversation attached to a window** to **portable agent infrastructure**: sessions run on remote hosts, consume any compatible model, work in parallel across worktrees, and close the review loop without leaving the Agents window.

### Move Toward ✅

- ✅ **Remote agent sessions** for long-running, environment-parity work — start on laptop, continue on owned infrastructure
- ✅ **BYOK with local or provider models** for tasks where model choice, cost control, or data residency matters
- ✅ **Utility model tuning** — assign a fast local model to background chat tasks and a frontier model to primary work
- ✅ **Open the Agents window** as the default agent surface — title bar **Open in Agents**, Command Palette, or `code --agents`
- ✅ **Parallel sessions in the Agents window** for concurrent efforts on independent tasks in the same repo
- ✅ **`/btw` for lateral questions** during long agent turns — redirect mid-flight without stopping the main task
- ✅ **GA browser tools for frontend validation** — close the build-screenshot-fix loop inside the session
- ✅ **Copilot Vision paste** for tables, mockups, and screenshots — attach the evidence instead of pasting a wall of text
- ✅ **In-window diff review** with actionable comments — review and redirect from the same surface that did the work

### Move Away From 🔄

- 🔄 **Only using the side Chat view for agent work** — the Agents window is the multi-session, multi-workspace surface
- 🔄 **Manual agent polling** — live pills and session grouping replace "check the terminal and come back"
- 🔄 **Pasting huge Excel ranges or logs as plain text** — Vision paste / file attach preserves structure the model can actually use
- 🔄 **Per-session model configuration** — utility model settings and BYOK provider defaults persist once configured
- 🔄 **Switching to the browser to validate changes** — device emulation and element comments keep validation in-window
- 🔄 **Separate PR review contexts** — CI failures and review comments surfaced in the Agents window session remove the need to context-switch to the PR tab

### Move Against 🛑

- 🛑 **Using BYOK for inline completions** — there is no BYOK path for ghost-text completions or NES; plan around GitHub sign-in for those features
- 🛑 **Remote agent sessions without managed settings** — AHP-connected remote hosts need the same terminal sandbox and approval settings as local sessions; leaving these unmanaged increases blast radius
- 🛑 **Treating Agents window parallelism as production-grade concurrency** — the window is preview; for CI-pipeline parallelism, use GitHub Actions with Copilot agent workflows

> **What This Looks Like:** A backend service needs a large API contract migration. The team starts a session in the Agents window, assigns it to a registered remote host, enables Autopilot, and disconnects for the evening. The session commits to an isolated worktree using a BYOK frontier model. The next morning, the developer reconnects, opens the in-window diff review, and works through the changes file by file — commenting, redirecting, and approving — without ever leaving the Agents window.

---

## When to Use This

### Decision Tree

```
Q: What does the workflow need?
├─ A dedicated place to run and track agents (not just side chat)

### Use This When

- The team runs an up-to-date VS Code build and has access to the Agents window (Preview)
- Developers currently only use the side Chat view and need a multi-session agent surface
- Model choice, cost visibility, or data residency requirements make BYOK or local models the right fit
- Tasks are large enough (> 30 min, > 5 files, multiple sub-tasks) to benefit from parallelism or remote execution
- Frontend workflows need browser validation without leaving the development context
- Context often arrives as screenshots, spreadsheets, or PDFs rather than clean source text

### Not the Right Fit When

- The primary need is inline code completions or next-edit suggestions — those require GitHub sign-in regardless of BYOK configuration
- Production-grade automation is required — the Agents window is preview; use GitHub Actions with Copilot-enabled workflows for reliable CI-level parallelism
- The team uses VS Code Remote SSH without the Agents window — the remote agent host is distinct from VS Code Remote and requires the AHP runtime on the target machine
- The demo assumes signed-out access to the Agents window without enabling and verifying its experimental settings

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Large Refactoring Run Overnight on Owned Infrastructure

**The Scenario:** A backend module with 40+ files needs migration to a new API contract. Running this as a local session would block the developer's machine for hours.

**How It Works:** Start a new session in the Agents window, assign it to a registered remote host, provide the migration spec, and enable Autopilot. Disconnect. The session continues on the remote host, commits per turn to an isolated worktree, and shows status on reconnect. The developer opens the in-window diff review and cherry-picks or approves file by file.[^1][^4]

**What We Get:** A full-night autonomous migration run without blocking local compute — with a review workflow that shows every file changed, in context, without switching tools.

---

### Use Case 2: Validating a Responsive Redesign Across Device Breakpoints

**The Scenario:** A frontend component needs to work correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The developer wants the agent to implement, screenshot, and confirm each breakpoint without manual browser switching.

**How It Works:** With GA browser tools and device emulation, the agent opens the component in the integrated browser, emulates each device preset (iPhone 15, Galaxy S24, iPad Pro), screenshots the result, and attaches element comments to any layout issue it finds. The developer sees the annotated screenshots in the chat turn.[^3][^5]

**What We Get:** A complete responsive validation pass — three device profiles, annotated screenshots, and per-element comments — in a single agent turn, without opening an external browser.

---

### Use Case 3: Running Two Approaches in Parallel to Pick the Better One

**The Scenario:** A team is unsure whether to implement a feature using a state machine or an event-sourcing pattern. Both are plausible; working prototypes of each are needed to compare.

**How It Works:** Open two sessions in the Agents window — one per approach. Both run in separate worktrees. A `/btw` query mid-run on either session captures observations without interrupting the turn. When both complete, the team reviews diffs side by side in the Agents window and picks the approach with clearer code and passing tests.[^4][^5]

**What We Get:** Two complete working prototypes — with full diffs and test results — produced in the time it previously took to produce one, with a decision framework that's code-grounded rather than opinion-based.

## ✅ What You Can Do Today

**15 minutes:**
- [ ] Update VS Code to 1.139 (or the latest stable patch) and check that `/btw`, live pills, and element comments are available
- [ ] Confirm the demo's GitHub sign-in and BYOK settings before opening the Agents window
- [ ] Open the **Agents window** once (title bar **Open in Agents**, Command Palette **Chat: Open Agents Window**, or `code --agents`) and start a session there instead of only in side chat
- [ ] Open **Manage Models…** in the chat model picker and add an Ollama endpoint or BYOK provider key — no GitHub Copilot subscription required
- [ ] Paste an Excel range or a UI screenshot into Chat and confirm Copilot Vision attaches it as an image instead of a text dump
- [ ] Confirm browser tools are active: open a localhost URL in the integrated browser and ask the agent to screenshot and describe the page
- [ ] Try `"workbench.browser.enableChatTools": true` if browser tools aren't responding (they default to on in 1.132)

**1 hour:**
- [ ] Pull a local model with Ollama and configure `chat.utilityModel` or `chat.utilitySmallModel` to use the model for background chat tasks
- [ ] Start a multi-session Agents window setup: two sessions on separate tasks in the same repo, each in its own worktree
- [ ] Use `/btw` during an active agent turn to ask a lateral question — confirm it runs without pausing the main conversation
- [ ] From the integrated browser toolbar, try **Add Screenshot to Chat** and **Add Element to Chat** on a localhost page
- [ ] Run a frontend task with device emulation: implement a component, ask the agent to screenshot it in mobile and desktop modes, and review the element comments

**2–4 hours:**
- [ ] If the team has a registered remote host, start a session through AHP and test reconnection after disconnecting VS Code; if using a Dev Container, check its configuration, remote Docker, and the rollout setting first
- [ ] Enable managed settings in the GitHub organization Copilot policy and verify that terminal sandbox settings propagate to developer machines
- [ ] Configure enterprise MCP allowlists in organization Copilot policy and confirm which MCP servers appear in the Agents window session settings
- [ ] Set up OTel trace export from agent sessions and confirm spans appear in your observability platform (Datadog, Grafana, or equivalent)
- [ ] Run a full closed-loop delivery test: implement a feature, validate in the browser with device emulation, push to a branch, watch CI failure surface in the session, and let the agent fix it without leaving the Agents window
