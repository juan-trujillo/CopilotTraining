# GitHub Code Quality: Turning Maintainability Into a Merge Gate

> **The Question This Talk Answers:**
> *"How does GitHub Code Quality turn maintainability, reliability, and coverage into an enforceable pre-merge gate — and what does it cost to run at scale?"*

**Duration:** 35-40 minutes | **Target Audience:** Developers, Repo Admins, Platform Teams

---

## 📊 Content Fitness

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Relevant** | 🟢 High | GitHub Code Quality reached general availability on July 20, 2026 — every team that touched the public preview now has a billing decision to make, and every team that didn't has a new pre-merge gate to evaluate. |
| **Compelling** | 🟢 High | The "aha" is that coverage stops being a dashboard number and becomes a rulesets-enforced merge gate, with an evaluate-only mode that lets teams see the blast radius before flipping it on. |
| **Actionable** | 🟢 High | Working ruleset JSON, an Actions workflow for Cobertura uploads, a rollout checklist, and a cost worksheet — all runnable this week on a real repo. |

**Overall Status:** 🟢 Ready to use

---

## The Opportunity

### What's Now Possible

- **Coverage on every pull request**
  Upload a Cobertura XML report from any test framework and GitHub Code Quality shows the coverage percentage and delta directly on the PR — no separate dashboard to check.

- **Quality gates that block or just watch**
  Rulesets can require minimum maintainability, reliability, or coverage scores before merge, and can run in `evaluate` mode first to show what *would* be blocked without stopping anyone.

- **AI-assisted detection alongside CodeQL**
  Deterministic CodeQL rules combine with AI-assisted analysis to catch maintainability and reliability issues that pattern-matching alone misses, with Copilot Autofix offering one-click suggestions.

- **Org-wide visibility into quality debt**
  Dashboards roll up maintainability and reliability scores across every enabled repository, so a platform team can see where technical debt is concentrated without opening each repo individually.

### The Emerging Practice

Teams that ran the public preview are moving code quality out of "something we look at occasionally" and into "something the merge button checks." A pull request now carries three signals side by side: what CodeQL and AI-assisted detection found, whether coverage went up or down, and whether either crosses a threshold the team has agreed to. Reviewers spend less time asking "did anyone check this?" because the check already ran and is sitting in the PR conversation.

The rollout pattern showing up across teams is a on-ramp, not a flip of a switch: enable Code Quality, watch quality scores accumulate for a sprint or two, turn on rulesets in `evaluate` mode to see what would have been blocked, then move to `active` enforcement once the false-positive rate is acceptable. Platform teams are also treating enablement itself as governed — since GA introduced per-committer billing, deciding *which* repos get Code Quality is now as deliberate a decision as deciding which repos get branch protection[^1].

---

## How It Works: GitHub Code Quality

### What It Does

GitHub Code Quality analyzes pull requests and the default branch for maintainability and reliability issues, using CodeQL plus AI-assisted detection, and layers test coverage reporting on top. Findings surface as PR comments with Copilot Autofix suggestions; rulesets turn any of these signals into a merge requirement[^2].

Enabling Code Quality does not automatically enable Copilot code review. GitHub disabled automatic review, review on new pushes, and draft review in GitHub-generated rulesets that still matched the original generated configuration. Edited generated rulesets and user-authored rulesets were left untouched. Teams can independently enable Copilot review with a repository or organization ruleset; that review remains billed to the Copilot plan[^12].

### Key Capabilities

- **Maintainability & reliability scoring**: Every scanned repo gets scored on these two dimensions, tracked over time on org and repo dashboards.
- **Cobertura-based coverage reporting**: Any CI system that can emit Cobertura XML (pytest-cov, JaCoCo, Istanbul/nyc, and others) feeds coverage numbers straight into the PR view[^3].
- **Copilot Autofix in the loop**: Findings include a suggested fix a developer applies with one click; a human still approves before it merges.
- **Ruleset-based enforcement**: Coverage and score thresholds live in the same rulesets mechanism already used for branch protection, with `evaluate` and `active` enforcement states[^4].

### Architecture Overview

A push or PR triggers two independent things: a CodeQL/AI-assisted scan of the changed code, and — if configured — a CI job that runs tests and emits a Cobertura XML report. The scan results and the coverage report both land in GitHub's Code Quality service, which merges them into a single PR-level view: findings grouped by severity, a coverage delta, and (if a ruleset applies) a pass/fail status check. Default-branch scans run on the same engine but feed the org-wide quality-debt backlog instead of a single PR.

## 🎯 Mental Model Shift

> **The Core Insight:** Code quality stops being a report someone reads and becomes a status check someone's merge depends on.

### Move Toward (Embrace These Patterns)

- ✅ **Coverage as a PR signal, not a nightly job**: Cobertura uploads happen on every PR run → reviewers see the delta before approving, not after a weekly report lands
- ✅ **Evaluate mode before active enforcement**: New rulesets start in `evaluate` → teams see exactly which historical PRs would have been blocked before anyone actually gets blocked
- ✅ **Autofix as a reviewer accelerant**: Copilot Autofix proposes the change, a human approves it → findings get resolved inside the PR instead of becoming a follow-up ticket

### Move Away From (Retire These Habits)

- 🔄 **Quarterly quality audits → continuous PR-level scoring**: As trust in the scores builds, quarterly manual reviews shrink to spot-checks of the dashboard trend line
- 🔄 **Coverage as a vanity metric → coverage as a merge condition**: Teams that used to eyeball a coverage badge start setting an actual minimum-coverage rule once they trust the delta reporting

### Move Against (Active Resistance)

- 🛑 **Enabling Code Quality org-wide without an enablement policy**: Every enabled repo counts committers toward the bill → audit which repos actually need it before flipping the org-wide switch
- 🛑 **Jumping straight to active enforcement**: Skipping evaluate mode risks blocking merges on findings nobody has triaged yet → always run evaluate mode for at least one full sprint first

> **What This Looks Like:** A developer opens a PR; within minutes the PR shows three lines — a maintainability finding with an Autofix button, a coverage delta of -2%, and a green ruleset check because the repo is still in evaluate mode. The developer applies the Autofix, coverage stays flagged for a human look, and the PR merges with full visibility into what was checked.

---

## When to Use This Pattern

### Decision Tree

```
Q: Does the repo already have CI producing test coverage output?
├─ Yes, in Cobertura-compatible format → Enable Code Quality + coverage upload directly
│  └─ Best for: repos with pytest-cov, JaCoCo, or nyc/Istanbul already configured
│
├─ Yes, but in a different format → Convert to Cobertura XML first, then enable coverage
│  └─ Best for: teams with existing coverage tooling that needs a small config change
│
└─ No CI coverage yet → Enable Code Quality for maintainability/reliability scanning first
   └─ Best for: repos starting from zero; add coverage once a baseline test suite exists
```

### Use This Pattern When

- The team wants pre-merge visibility into maintainability and reliability issues without hand-rolling a separate linter/scanner pipeline
- Coverage regressions are a real risk (large team, frequent contributors, legacy code with uneven test coverage)
- There's an appetite to eventually make some quality signal a hard merge requirement, not just an FYI

### Don't Use This Pattern When

- The repo is on GitHub Enterprise Server — Code Quality is Enterprise Cloud and Team only as of GA
- The org can't yet answer "who counts as an active committer here" — enabling blind adds unpredictable per-seat billing
- The team wants a single tool for security *and* quality — Code Quality is a standalone product, not bundled with GitHub Advanced Security

### Comparison with Related Features

| Aspect | GitHub Code Quality | GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL alone) | Third-party linters/coverage tools |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Best For** | Maintainability + reliability + coverage in one PR view | Security vulnerability scanning | Language-specific style/lint rules |
| **Strengths** | Native PR integration, Autofix, org dashboards | Deep security-focused CodeQL queries | Highly customizable per language |
| **Limitations** | Standalone billing, Enterprise Cloud/Team only | Doesn't cover coverage or maintainability scoring | No native ruleset/merge-gate integration |
| **Setup Time** | ~15 min to enable, ~1 hr to add coverage + gates | Already familiar to GHAS users | Varies widely by tool |

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Coverage Gates -->
## Coverage-Aware Quality Gates

### From Cobertura Report to PR Status Check

Once a workflow uploads a Cobertura XML report, Code Quality attaches a coverage percentage and delta to the PR. That number becomes actionable the moment a ruleset references it as a required threshold.

```json
{
  "name": "Require 80% coverage on main",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "evaluate",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["refs/heads/main"],
      "exclude": []
    }
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "type": "code_quality",
      "parameters": {
        "minimum_coverage_percentage": 80
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `enforcement: "evaluate"` reports what would fail without blocking any merge — this is the safe starting state for a new ruleset
- `minimum_coverage_percentage` reads the delta already computed from the uploaded Cobertura report; no separate coverage service is needed
- Switching to `"enforcement": "active"` is a one-line change once the evaluate-mode data looks trustworthy[^5]

### Feeding the Gate: The Coverage Upload Workflow

The ruleset is only as good as the coverage data feeding it. In public preview for Code Quality users on github.com, Code Quality settings can start an agent that opens a reviewable pull request with a least-privilege workflow. The generated workflow builds the project, runs tests, produces coverage, and uploads the report to GitHub while requesting only the permissions needed for those tasks[^13].

The generated pull request is an onboarding path, not a replacement for custom CI. Teams that need specific build steps, test matrices, coverage tooling, or upload behavior can still author the workflow manually. A minimal manual Actions workflow producing that data:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  code-quality: write
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt pytest pytest-cov
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml:cobertura.xml
      - name: Upload coverage to GitHub Code Quality
        uses: actions/upload-code-coverage@v1
        with:
          file: cobertura.xml
          language: Python
          label: code-coverage/pytest
```

**Key Points:**
- `code-quality: write` permission is required for the upload step to succeed
- The `label` field lets multiple coverage uploads (e.g., per-service in a monorepo) show up distinctly on the same PR
- Any framework that can emit Cobertura XML works the same way — JaCoCo for Java, nyc/Istanbul for JavaScript/TypeScript[^3]

### Before / After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Coverage checked in a separate dashboard, reviewed weekly | Coverage delta shown inline on every PR, reviewed before merge |
| "We should have 80% coverage" as a team norm | 80% coverage as a ruleset a PR literally cannot bypass in active mode |

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Autofix in the PR Loop -->
## Copilot Autofix in the PR Loop

### What Gets Found

Findings on a PR are grouped into two categories:

- **Maintainability** — complexity, duplication, readability issues that make future changes harder
- **Reliability** — patterns known to cause bugs, drawing on both CodeQL's deterministic rules and AI-assisted detection for patterns outside existing CodeQL query coverage

Each finding carries a severity label and, where available, a Copilot Autofix suggestion.

### The Review Flow

1. A PR opens or updates; Code Quality scans the diff.
2. Findings post as PR comments, each with context on why it was flagged.
3. A developer reviews the suggested Autofix, applies it with one click, or dismisses it with a reason.
4. A human reviewer still approves the PR — Autofix proposes, it doesn't auto-merge.

### Default-Branch Scans: Working Off the Backlog

The same engine scans the default branch on a schedule, surfacing accumulated findings as a scored backlog rather than PR-blocking issues. Teams can triage this backlog directly or assign individual findings to the Copilot coding agent to draft a fix as its own PR[^2].

**Key Points:**
- PR-time findings and default-branch findings use the same scoring model, so a team can watch its backlog shrink as new PRs each disposition a few items
- Autofix suggestions are proposals — nothing merges without explicit human approval
- GitHub reports internally that a majority of findings (self-reported at roughly two-thirds) are resolved before merge, though this varies by team and codebase[^1]

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Rolling Out at Scale -->
## Rolling Out Without Surprises

### Enterprise-Level Enablement

Enterprise owners control whether Code Quality can be used at all, before any org or repo can turn it on:

1. Enterprise settings → **Policies** → **Code Quality**
2. Choose **Allow for all organizations** or **Allow for selected organizations**
3. Optionally allow repo admins to enable/disable at the repo level within allowed orgs[^6]

### The Evaluate-First Rollout Pattern

```markdown
# enterprise-rollout-checklist.md (excerpt)

## Phase 1 — Enable & Observe (1-2 sprints)
- [ ] Allow Code Quality for the target org(s) at the enterprise policy level
- [ ] Enable on a pilot set of repos (not org-wide yet)
- [ ] Add coverage upload workflow to pilot repos
- [ ] Do NOT create any enforcing rulesets yet

## Phase 2 — Evaluate Mode (1 sprint)
- [ ] Create rulesets with enforcement: "evaluate"
- [ ] Review which historical PRs would have been blocked
- [ ] Tune thresholds based on false-positive rate

## Phase 3 — Active Enforcement
- [ ] Switch ruleset enforcement to "active" for pilot repos
- [ ] Expand to remaining repos in the org, repeating Phase 1-2 per repo group
- [ ] Set up org dashboard review as a recurring cadence
```

**Key Points:**
- Evaluate mode is the safety net that prevents a new ruleset from blocking merges nobody has reviewed
- Rolling out repo-by-repo (rather than org-wide on day one) keeps the active-committer count — and therefore the bill — predictable
- Org dashboards become useful once more than a handful of repos are enabled; before that, per-repo review is simpler[^4]

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Reading the Bill -->
## Reading the Bill

### The Three Line Items

GitHub Code Quality's GA billing has three independent components:

1. **Active committers** — $10/month per person who pushed a commit to any Code-Quality-enabled repo in the org in the trailing 90 days, counted once org-wide
2. **AI credits** — usage-based charge (≈$0.01/credit) for AI-assisted detection and Copilot Autofix generation
3. **CodeQL compute** — GitHub Actions minutes consumed by the scan workflows (or self-hosted runner cost)

### Worked Example

```markdown
# cost-estimation-worksheet.md (excerpt)

Org: 50 active committers across 12 enabled repos

Base license:      50 committers × $10/month        = $500/month
AI credits:        ~2,000 credits/month (estimate)    = $20/month
CodeQL compute:    ~1,500 Actions minutes/month        = included or billed
                   at the org's existing Actions rate
                   -----------------------------------------
Estimated total:   ~$520+/month, before Actions overage
```

**Key Points:**
- The active-committer count is org-wide, not per-repo — enabling Code Quality on five repos with the same 50 people costs the same as enabling it on one
- AI credit usage scales with how many findings trigger AI-assisted analysis and Autofix generation, not with repo count directly
- Auditing which repos are enabled *before* the billing period starts is the single highest-leverage cost control available, since disabling a repo removes its committers from the active count going forward[^7]

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Catching a Coverage Regression Before It Merges

**The Scenario:** A team ships a new feature branch that adds code but skips writing tests for one edge case, dropping overall coverage by 4%.

**How It Works:** The PR's Actions workflow uploads the Cobertura report as usual; Code Quality computes the delta and a ruleset in active mode with `minimum_coverage_percentage: 80` fails the check because the drop puts the branch below threshold.

**Example:**
```bash
gh pr checks 482
# code-quality/coverage    fail   Coverage 76% (was 80%, min 80%)
```

**What You Get:** The coverage gap is visible and blocking before merge, not discovered three sprints later during an incident postmortem.

---

### Use Case 2: Working Off Default-Branch Quality Debt

**The Scenario:** A legacy repo has accumulated hundreds of maintainability findings over years of PRs merged before Code Quality was enabled.

**How It Works:** Enabling Code Quality triggers a full default-branch scan, populating the org dashboard's quality-debt backlog. High-severity reliability findings get assigned to the Copilot coding agent, which opens draft PRs with proposed fixes for a reviewer to approve.

**Example:**
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/code-quality/findings --jq '.[] | select(.severity=="high")'
```

**What You Get:** A prioritized, scored backlog instead of an unstructured wall of legacy code — and a way to chip away at it without a dedicated "tech debt sprint."

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes

### How CodeQL and AI-Assisted Detection Combine

Code Quality doesn't replace CodeQL's deterministic query engine — it runs alongside it. CodeQL contributes maintainability and reliability findings from its existing, well-tested query set. AI-assisted detection is layered on top to catch patterns that fall outside what a deterministic query can express (context-dependent complexity, naming/readability judgment calls, cross-file patterns that are expensive to encode as a static query). Both feed the same finding stream and severity model, so a developer reading PR comments sees one unified list rather than two separate tools to reconcile.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding that AI-assisted findings sit alongside — not instead of — CodeQL findings explains why some findings have deterministic, always-reproducible triggers while others may vary slightly run to run. It also explains the AI-credit line item on the bill: only the AI-assisted portion of the scan consumes credits, not the CodeQL portion.
