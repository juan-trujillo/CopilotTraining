# Copilot Configuration Primitives: Making AI Understand Your Codebase

> **The Question This Talk Answers:**
> *"How can I make GitHub Copilot understand my codebase better?"*

**Duration:** 50 minutes | **Target Audience:** Developers / Team Leads / Platform Engineers

---

## 📊 Content Fitness

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Relevant** | 🟢 High | Every team using Copilot asks this exact question — these 4 primitives are the official answer |
| **Compelling** | 🟢 High | Transforms Copilot from a generic coding assistant to a team-specific development partner through a progressive layering model |
| **Actionable** | 🟢 High | Build and inspect one production-ready example for every primitive, then verify loading and output independently |

**Overall Status:** 🟢 Ready to use

---


## The Problem

### Key Points

- **Generic responses that ignore project conventions**
  Copilot suggests textbook patterns instead of code that matches your team's architecture, naming conventions, and technology stack

- **Repeated context in every conversation**
  Developers manually explain the same project details — "we use Prisma, not raw SQL" — in every chat session

- **Inconsistent AI behavior across a team**
  Each developer gets different quality responses because they provide different context. No shared baseline.

- **One-size-fits-all doesn't fit anyone**
  Default Copilot treats a React frontend and a Python data pipeline identically. It shouldn't.

### Narrative

When developers first adopt GitHub Copilot, the initial experience is impressive — but quickly hits a ceiling. You ask Copilot to add a database table and it generates raw SQL when your project uses Prisma. You ask for a test and it suggests Mocha patterns when your team standardized on Vitest. Every conversation starts from zero because Copilot has no memory of your project's conventions.

This isn't a limitation of the AI model — it's a context problem. Copilot's response quality is directly proportional to how much it knows about your specific codebase[^1]. Without explicit configuration, it answers generically, like a contractor who's never seen your blueprints.

The solution isn't better prompting. It's **configuration** — instructions, prompts, skills, agents, and now increasingly `AGENTS.md` as an open agent-facing playbook. Together, these give every Copilot interaction persistent awareness of your codebase's architecture, conventions, and workflows[^3][^13].

---

## The Solution: Configuration Primitives That Layer Cleanly

### What It Does

GitHub Copilot supports four core configuration building blocks, and teams increasingly pair them with `AGENTS.md` when they want a portable, agent-focused instruction surface. Each primitive is a Markdown file committed to your repository, making your Copilot configuration version-controlled, team-shared, and reviewable[^1][^13].

### Key Capabilities

- **Instructions**: Always-on guardrails — coding standards, project structure, and build procedures injected into every request automatically[^2]
- **AGENTS.md**: Agent playbook — open-format setup, testing, and local operating guidance that many coding agents understand[^13]
- **Prompts**: Proven task recipes — freeze a solved workflow as a team `/command`[^3]
- **Skills**: Graduated capabilities — the same recipe plus scripts and templates the agent can run[^4]
- **Agents**: Specialized AI personas — constrained tools, instructions, and model preferences for specific roles[^5]

### Architecture Overview

The primitives form a progressive stack. GitHub instructions are the foundation — always present, zero-effort. `AGENTS.md` complements them with a predictable place for commands, test steps, and nearest-directory workflow guidance. Custom prompts come next: that is how most developers actually work. They solve a messy task in chat, then freeze the working recipe as a `/command`. Skills are the graduation step, not the first automation — add scripts and templates only after the prompt is proven. Agents sit at the top, composing the other primitives into constrained personas.

Each primitive builds on the ones below it. A prompt should link to instructions instead of copying them. A skill packages a proven prompt. An agent can inherit instructions, invoke prompts, and load skills behind a tool boundary[^3].

### Model and Provider Configuration Boundary

Use **Manage Language Models** in VS Code when the decision is which provider or model backs chat, tools, and MCP interactions. Bring Your Own Key can support those experiences without GitHub sign-in; Stable Custom Endpoint is the durable custom-provider contract, and utility model settings let teams choose smaller models for supporting tasks. Keep the authentication boundary explicit: inline suggestions and next edit suggestions still require GitHub sign-in even when chat uses a BYOK provider.[^14][^15]

## 🎯 Mental Model Shift

> **The Core Insight:** From repeating context in every conversation to encoding knowledge once in configuration files that make every interaction smarter.

### Move Toward (Embrace These Patterns)

- ✅ **File-based configuration over manual context**: Encode conventions in `.github/` once instead of repeating them in every prompt → Copilot automatically applies your standards to every interaction[^2]
- ✅ **Progressive enhancement**: Start with one `copilot-instructions.md`, freeze a solved task as a prompt, then graduate to a skill → Avoids over-engineering, delivers value immediately
- ✅ **Team-shared AI knowledge in version control**: Configuration files become reviewable institutional knowledge → New team members get project-aware AI from day one
- ✅ **Layered context**: Instructions for baseline, prompts for solved tasks, skills for runnable packs, agents for personas → Each layer serves a different purpose without duplication

### Move Away From (Retire These Habits)

- ⚠️ **Copy-pasting context into every prompt**: Instructions eliminate this repetitive work → Saves minutes per interaction, hundreds of hours per year across a team
- ⚠️ **One-size-fits-all AI interaction**: Different tasks need different context levels → A planning task needs different tools than an implementation task
- ⚠️ **Leaving shared conventions implicit**: Generic output forces the same corrections to recur → Encode stable conventions in the smallest fitting primitive

### Move Against (Active Resistance Required)

- 🛑 **Over-engineering with agents first**: Start with the smallest artifact that solves the repeated problem → Add orchestration after the workflow and evidence are stable
- 🛑 **Massive instruction files**: Keep instructions concise and scoped → Preserve context capacity for the request, relevant code, and tool results
- 🛑 **Task-specific content in instructions**: Instructions should be general conventions, not step-by-step workflows → Use prompts for task-specific workflows instead

> **Example Transformation:** Before: Developer types "Add a user endpoint" and gets generic Express boilerplate with `var`, no types, and `console.log` error handling. After: Same prompt produces TypeScript endpoint with Prisma queries, custom error classes, JSDoc comments, and co-located test file — because instructions define the conventions and a prompt encodes the scaffolding workflow.

---

## Place, Load, and Prove the Context

The primitive is only one part of the design. Before creating a file, classify the context so a stable team rule does not become a personal memory, a one-request detail does not become permanent policy, and a specialized role does not receive unnecessary tools.

| Decision | Question | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner** | Who may maintain and approve this context? | A code owner reviews repository instructions; an individual controls a personal preference |
| **Lifetime** | How long should it remain useful? | One request, repeated task, repository lifetime, or organizational policy cycle |
| **Selector** | Which requests should receive it? | Whole repository, matching files, explicit `/command`, relevant task, or selected agent |
| **Evidence** | What observable signal proves success? | Loaded customization, tool trace, test result, diff, and required reviewer approval |

Shared, repeated behavior proceeds into the primitive decision tree below. One-request facts stay in the request. Personal preferences stay user-controlled. Sensitive data, credentials, customer records, and production payloads stay outside prompts, memory, and repository examples.

### Loaded Does Not Mean Followed

Treat the evidence as a sequence of separate claims:

1. **Eligible**: the selector matches the request.
2. **Loaded**: the client reports that the customization was included.
3. **Executed**: the expected files and tools were used.
4. **Validated**: tests, type checks, or other deterministic checks pass.
5. **Accepted**: the accountable reviewer approves the result.

The References panel or diagnostic trace can prove delivery. It cannot prove that every instruction was followed or that the generated artifact is acceptable.[^16][^17]

### Repair the First Broken Boundary

When configured behavior fails, inspect the sequence in order: confirm the target file and request, check selector eligibility, inspect loaded customizations and tool activity, repair the first failed boundary, then rerun independent checks. Promote the context only after repeated value and owner approval.

This verification loop keeps the tutorial practical: **place the context, encode it with the smallest primitive, inspect delivery, and prove the result.**

---

## When to Use This Pattern

### Decision Tree

```
Q: What kind of customization do you need?
│
├─ "GitHub Copilot should always know our repo conventions"
│  → Use: Repo Instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
│  └─ Best for: Coding standards, build procedures, repo-wide GitHub guidance
│
├─ "Different rules should apply to different files or folders"
│  → Use: Path-specific Instructions (.instructions.md with applyTo)
│  └─ Best for: Language-specific rules, test conventions, framework patterns
│
├─ "Agents need local commands, test steps, or subproject guardrails"
│  → Use: AGENTS.md
│  └─ Best for: Monorepos, subproject playbooks, cross-agent portability
│
├─ "A solved workflow the team should share as a /command"
│  → Use: Prompts (.github/prompts/*.prompt.md)
│  └─ Best for: Component scaffolding, code review checklists, PR templates
│
├─ "The recipe is proven and now needs scripts, templates, or auto-load"
│  → Use: Skills (.github/skills/*/SKILL.md)
│  └─ Best for: Testing workflows, deployment scripts, portable expertise
│
└─ "Specialized AI persona with constrained tools"
   → Use: Agents (.github/agents/*.agent.md)
   └─ Best for: Planning vs. implementation, database admin, security review
```

### Comparison with Related Primitives

| Aspect | **Repo Instructions** | **Path Instructions** | **AGENTS.md** | **Prompts** | **Skills** | **Agents** |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Loading** | Always-on | Conditional by `applyTo` | Nearest relevant file in supporting agents | User invokes (`/`) | On-demand and/or `/skill` | User selects |
| **Scope** | Whole repository | Matching files only | Repo or subproject | Single task | When relevant or invoked | Full session |
| **File Path** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` | `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` |
| **Can Include** | Markdown text | Markdown + frontmatter | Markdown playbook text | Variables, tool specs | Scripts, examples, templates | Tool restrictions, handoffs |
| **Best For** | Repo constitution | File-pattern precision | Commands, tests, local workflow rules | Proven team recipes | Graduated runnable packs | Role-based personas |
| **Portability** | GitHub / VS Code guidance | GitHub / VS Code guidance | Cross-agent/open convention | VS Code | VS Code + CLI + coding agent | VS Code |
| **Typical Selector** | "Always in this repo" | "Only for these files" | "Only in this directory tree" | "When I run this command" | "When this task appears" | "When I want this persona" |

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Instructions -->
## Instructions: The Foundation

Instructions are Markdown files that provide persistent context to every Copilot interaction. They're the simplest and most impactful primitive — a single file can transform Copilot from "generic coding assistant" to "team-aware development partner"[^2].

### The Three Instruction Surfaces

Think about instructions as three different selectors:

- **Repository selector**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` applies across the whole repo
- **File-pattern selector**: `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` applies when `applyTo` matches
- **Directory selector**: `AGENTS.md` gives the nearest relevant package or service its own playbook[^13]

That distinction matters. If the rule is "always use Vitest in this repo," use `copilot-instructions.md`. If the rule is "only for `src/models/**/*.ts`," use `.instructions.md`. If the rule is "inside `infra/`, run Terraform plan before apply," use `infra/AGENTS.md`.

### How Instructions Work

When you create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository, its contents are automatically injected into every Copilot Chat request made in that repository context[^1]. No special syntax, no activation step — just Markdown that Copilot reads before answering.

VS Code shows which instruction files were used in the **References** section of each chat response, so you can verify they're being applied[^2].

### Repository-Wide Instructions

The primary instructions file lives at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and applies to all requests:

```markdown
# Repository Instructions

This repository uses TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

## Build and Test
- Always run `npm install` before building
- Build: `npm run build`
- Tests are in `__tests__/` directories co-located with source files
- Use Vitest — never Mocha or Jest
- Run tests: `npm test`

## Coding Standards
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use explicit return types for all functions
- Add JSDoc comments for exported functions
- Use named exports (avoid default exports)

## File Structure
src/
  components/       # React components
  utils/           # Utility functions
  services/        # API clients
  __tests__/       # Tests co-located with source

## Error Handling
- Use custom error classes that extend Error
- Log errors with structured logging (use logger.error())
- Never swallow errors silently
```

See the full example in [`examples/copilot-instructions.md`](examples/copilot-instructions.md).

### Path-Specific Instructions

For codebases where different areas have different conventions, use `.instructions.md` files with `applyTo` glob patterns[^2]:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/models/**/*.ts"
---

# Database Model Instructions

When working with database models in this project:

1. Use Prisma schema definitions in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Include JSDoc comments with field descriptions
3. Define relationships explicitly with `@relation`
4. Add indexes for foreign keys
5. Use snake_case for database column names, camelCase in TypeScript
6. Always include audit fields: `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
```

Path-specific instructions are stored in `.github/instructions/` and only activate when Copilot is working on files matching the glob pattern. They combine with repository-wide instructions — both are used when both match[^1].

### AGENTS.md: The Open Agent Playbook

`AGENTS.md` is a simple open Markdown format for guiding coding agents. It is best used for information that looks like a playbook: setup commands, test commands, PR expectations, repository navigation tips, and subproject-specific guardrails[^13].

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Dev environment tips
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
- Start the frontend with `pnpm --filter web dev`

## Testing instructions
- Run `pnpm --filter web test`
- Run `pnpm --filter web lint` before opening a PR

## PR instructions
- Title format: [web] <Title>
```

In a polyrepo, a single root `AGENTS.md` may be enough. In a monorepo, nested files such as `frontend/AGENTS.md` and `infra/AGENTS.md` let each area define its own commands without overloading one giant repo-level document.

**Key Points:**
- Instructions are always-on — no manual activation required
- Keep instructions concise enough to leave room for the request, relevant code, and tool results
- Remove conflicting guidance instead of depending on an assumed precedence order
- Use the `/init` command to auto-generate instructions from your workspace[^2]
- Use `AGENTS.md` when a directory needs local commands, tests, or cross-agent workflow guidance[^13]

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Custom Prompts -->
## Custom Prompts: Solved Workflows

Prompt files are Markdown templates that freeze a workflow you already solved in chat. Unlike instructions (always-on), prompts are explicitly invoked by developers using `/command` syntax. That is the usual next step after `/init` — not a skill folder invented from a blank buffer[^3].

### How Prompts Work

Create a `.prompt.md` file in `.github/prompts/`, or run `/create-prompt` after a chat that already produced the right files. The result becomes a slash command. Type `/` in chat, select your prompt, and fill the parameters[^3]:

```
/component
```

### Prompt File Structure

```markdown
---
name: component
description: Generate a React component with TypeScript, tests, and docs
tools: ['editFiles', 'createFile']
agent: agent
---

# Component Generator

Create a new React component: ${input:componentName:Component name}

## Files to Create

src/components/${input:componentName}/
  ${input:componentName}.tsx
  ${input:componentName}.types.ts
  ${input:componentName}.module.css
  __tests__/
    ${input:componentName}.test.tsx
  index.ts

## Requirements
- Use functional components with hooks
- Include TypeScript props interface with JSDoc
- Follow conventions in [coding standards](../../copilot-instructions.md)
- Add unit tests using Vitest
```

See the full prompt in [`examples/component.prompt.md`](examples/component.prompt.md).

### What Makes Prompts Powerful

Prompts can reference instructions files via Markdown links, ensuring consistency without duplication. They support `${input:variableName}`, `${selection}`, and `${file}`, and they can specify which agent and tools to use[^3]:

```markdown
---
tools: ['editFiles', 'search', 'readFile']
agent: agent
---
```

**Key Points:**
- Prompts are human-triggered recipes — freeze them after the chat already worked
- Link to `copilot-instructions.md`. Do not copy the constitution into every prompt
- Support variables: `${selection}`, `${file}`, `${input:name:placeholder}`
- Specify tools and agent to constrain this one task
- Store in `.github/prompts/` (workspace) or user profile (global)
- A skill can also appear as `/skill`. Stay on a prompt until you have scripts or need auto-load

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Skills -->
## Skills: Graduate the Proven Prompt

Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file plus supporting scripts, examples, and resources. Graduate a prompt into a skill after the recipe is proven — especially when the agent needs a script or template it can actually run. By default a skill can both auto-load and appear as `/skill`[^4].

### How Skills Work: Progressive Loading

Skills use a three-level loading system that keeps context efficient[^4]:

| Level | What Loads | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **1. Discovery** | Skill name + description only | Always (lightweight metadata) |
| **2. Instructions** | Full SKILL.md body | When your prompt matches the skill description |
| **3. Resources** | Scripts, examples, templates | When Copilot references them during execution |

This means you can have dozens of skills installed without impacting context — only relevant skills load their full content.

### Skill Structure

```
.github/skills/
  test-runner/
    SKILL.md                 # Instructions + metadata
    scripts/
      run-tests.sh           # Linked from SKILL.md — actually executed
    assets/
      test-template.ts       # Linked from SKILL.md — new tests start here
    examples/
      api-test.ts            # Example test for reference
```

### Example: Test Runner Skill

```markdown
---
name: test-runner
description: Run tests, analyze failures, and suggest fixes for unit and
  integration tests. Use when asked to test, debug test failures, or add
  test coverage.
---

# Test Runner Skill

## When to Use
- User asks to test an API endpoint
- User wants to validate request/response contracts
- Debugging failing integration tests

## Process
1. Identify the endpoint under test from route files in `src/routes/`
2. Check existing tests in `tests/api/` for patterns
3. Run [scripts/run-tests.sh](scripts/run-tests.sh)
4. Start new files from [assets/test-template.ts](assets/test-template.ts)
```

See the full skill definition in [`examples/test-runner-skill.md`](examples/test-runner-skill.md).

### Skills Are an Open Standard

Agent Skills work across VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and GitHub Copilot coding agent[^7]. Skills you write for VS Code automatically work in the terminal and in GitHub's automated coding workflows. The specification is maintained at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/).

**Key Points:**
- Default is both auto-load and `/skill`. Set `user-invocable: false` to hide the slash command, or `disable-model-invocation: true` for slash-only
- Unlinked files in the folder are invisible — reference every script and template from `SKILL.md`
- Portable across VS Code, Copilot CLI, and Copilot coding agent[^7]
- Store project skills in `.github/skills/`, personal skills in `~/.copilot/skills/`
- Use `/create-skill` after the prompt already works. Do not invent a capability from a blank folder

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Agents -->
## Agents: Specialized AI Personas

Custom agents combine instructions, tool restrictions, and model preferences into a specialized persona that you select from the agents dropdown in chat[^5]. Where instructions set the rules and prompts define tasks, agents define **who** the AI becomes for a session.

### Why Constrain the AI?

Different tasks need different capabilities. A planning agent should only read files (preventing accidental edits). A security reviewer needs search tools but not terminal access. A database admin needs terminal and SQL tools but shouldn't touch frontend code[^5].

Agents let you configure exactly which tools are available — and which aren't.

### Agent File Structure

```markdown
---
name: planner
description: Generate implementation plans by researching the codebase.
  Read-only — never modifies files.
tools: ['search', 'readFile', 'listFiles', 'fetch']
model: Claude Sonnet 4 (copilot)
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: agent
    prompt: Implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false
---

# Planning Agent

You are a senior software architect creating implementation plans.

## Your Process
1. Understand the requirement by asking clarifying questions
2. Research the existing codebase using search and file reading
3. Identify affected files and components
4. Generate a step-by-step implementation plan with:
   - Files to create or modify
   - Key code changes described in detail
   - Test strategy
   - Potential risks or considerations

## Rules
- NEVER modify files — you are read-only
- Always cite specific files and line numbers
- Include effort estimates for each step
```

### Handoffs: Multi-Agent Workflows

Agents support **handoffs** — suggested next steps that transition between agents with context preserved[^5]. After the planning agent finishes, a "Start Implementation" button appears that switches to the implementation agent with the plan as context:

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: agent
    prompt: Implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false
  - label: Review Code
    agent: security-reviewer
    prompt: Review the implementation for security issues.
```

This creates guided, sequential workflows: Plan → Implement → Review. Each agent has its own tools and constraints, but context flows between them.

### Example: Database Administrator Agent

The database agent in [`examples/database.agent.md`](examples/database.agent.md) demonstrates a fully specified agent with:
- Constrained tools (terminal, code_editor, database_query)
- A deliberate model selection boundary
- Detailed persona instructions covering schema design, migrations, and query optimization

**Key Points:**
- Agents constrain which tools the AI can use for a specific role
- Handoffs enable guided multi-agent workflows (Plan → Implement → Review)
- Agents can reference instructions and invoke skills
- Subagents can run as delegated tasks within an agent session[^5]
- Store in `.github/agents/` (workspace) or user profile (global)

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Choosing the Right Primitive -->
## Choosing the Right Primitive

### Start Simple, Add Complexity When Needed

Most teams should follow this progression:

| Week | Action | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Week 1** | Run `/init` and trim `copilot-instructions.md` | Immediate: project-aware responses |
| **Week 2** | Add path-specific `.instructions.md` files with `applyTo` | Targeted: language-specific conventions |
| **Week 3** | `/create-prompt` on a task the team already solved | Consistent: shared `/command` |
| **Month 2** | `/create-skill` — add a script and a template | Portable: the agent can run the pack |
| **Month 3** | `/create-agent` for a read-only Planner and one handoff | Constrained: tool boundaries as architecture |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | What to Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Start with agents | Over-engineers simple problems | Start with instructions |
| Oversized instructions file | Consumes context budget for actual work | Keep only stable, broadly useful rules |
| Task-specific instructions | Bloats every request with irrelevant context | Use prompts for tasks |
| Duplicating rules across files | Creates maintenance burden and conflicts | Reference instructions from prompts |
| Skipping configuration entirely | Repeats the same avoidable corrections | Start with one concise instructions file |

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Monorepo with Multiple Technologies

**The Problem:** Large repository with React frontend, Node.js backend, and React Native mobile — Copilot suggests wrong patterns for each area.

**The Solution:** Path-specific instructions apply TypeScript/React conventions for `src/web/**`, Express patterns for `src/api/**`, and React Native best practices for `src/mobile/**`.

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/web/**/*.tsx"
---
# Frontend Instructions
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Style with TailwindCSS utility classes
- Use React Query for data fetching
```

**Evidence:** Generate one change in each area and inspect whether the matching instruction file loaded and the framework-specific checks passed.

---

### Use Case 2: Test-Driven Development Standardization

**The Problem:** Team practices TDD but each developer generates tests differently — inconsistent patterns, missing edge cases.

**The Solution:** `/test` prompt file generates tests following team standards. Test-runner skill analyzes failures and suggests fixes using project-specific patterns.

**Evidence:** Compare generated tests against the team template, run the suite, and review whether failures are explained using repository-specific patterns.

### Use Case 3: Database Schema Changes with Safety

**The Problem:** Multiple developers making schema changes create inconsistent migrations, missing indexes, and no rollback safety.

**The Solution:** Database admin agent with constrained tools enforces Third Normal Form, generates up/down migrations, suggests indexes, and provides EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

**Evidence:** Require migration checks, rollback instructions, query-plan evidence, and database-owner approval before acceptance.

### Use Case 4: Accelerated Onboarding

**The Problem:** New team members take 2 weeks to make their first meaningful commit because they don't understand codebase conventions.

**The Solution:** Instructions document architecture and conventions. `/onboard` prompt provides guided codebase tour. Copilot answers "where is X?" questions correctly from day one.

**Evidence:** Ask a new contributor to locate, change, test, and explain one bounded feature using only committed guidance; record the corrections still required.

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes

### How Primitives Load at Runtime

Understanding the loading order clarifies why the layered architecture matters:

1. **Session Start**: Repository-wide guidance such as `.github/copilot-instructions.md` establishes the baseline context
2. **File Open**: `.instructions.md` files are evaluated for matching `applyTo` patterns and added when relevant
3. **Chat Request**: Skill discovery runs — names and descriptions are checked against user prompt for relevance
4. **Skill Match**: If a skill description matches, its full `SKILL.md` body is loaded into context (Level 2)
5. **Agent Selection**: When user switches to a custom agent, its instructions and tool constraints replace defaults
6. **Prompt Invocation**: When user types `/command`, prompt file merges with current instructions + agent context

For agent ecosystems that support `AGENTS.md`, the nearest file in the directory tree acts like a local operating manual: "here are the commands, tests, and guardrails for this part of the repo." That is why `AGENTS.md` is especially compelling in monorepos[^13].

### Context Budget Management

All primitives share the model's context window. This is why the progressive loading architecture matters — always-on instructions consume baseline budget, on-demand skills only load when needed, and unused agents consume nothing.

**Rule of thumb**: Instructions (2 pages max) + active skill + prompt + your conversation history should fit comfortably within context. If you're hitting limits, your instructions are probably too long.

### Tool Priority Resolution

When multiple primitives specify tools, the priority order is[^3]:

1. Tools specified in prompt file (highest priority)
2. Tools from the referenced custom agent in prompt file
3. Default tools for the selected agent (lowest priority)

**Key Takeaway:** If a prompt specifies tools, those override any agent-level tool restrictions. Design your tool lists intentionally to avoid accidental privilege escalation.
