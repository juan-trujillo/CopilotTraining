Mark major sections that should appear in the TOC with 🎬 marker in a comment:

```markdown
<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: [Short Name for TOC Card] -->
## [Full Section Heading]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use 3-6 major sections (fits 2×2 or 2×3 grid in TOC)
- Each major section = 2-5 content slides
- Major sections should be "deep dive" technical content, not front matter
- Examples: "Core Architecture", "Implementation Patterns", "Advanced Features"

---

## The Problem

### Key Points

- **[Issue 1]**
  [1 sentence describing the challenge or limitation]

- **[Issue 2]**
  [1 sentence describing the challenge or limitation]

- **[Issue 3]**
  [1 sentence describing the challenge or limitation]

- **[Issue 4]**
  [1 sentence describing the challenge or limitation]

### Narrative

[2-3 paragraphs telling the story of the problem. Set the scene: who experiences this, what makes it frustrating, what's the cost of not solving it. Paint a picture that makes readers think "yes, that's exactly my situation." Include specific examples, time costs, or failure scenarios.]

---

## The Solution: [Feature Name]

### What It Does

[2-3 sentences explaining the core capability and its primary mechanism. Focus on the "what" and "how" at a high level.]

### Key Capabilities

- **[Capability 1]**: [Brief description with specific benefit]
- **[Capability 2]**: [Brief description with specific benefit]
- **[Capability 3]**: [Brief description with specific benefit]
- **[Capability 4]**: [Brief description with specific benefit]

### Architecture Overview

[2-3 paragraphs explaining how the solution works. Include component relationships, data flow, or execution model. Use analogies if helpful. Keep it accessible—deep dives come later.]

**Official Documentation:**
- 📖 [Main Feature Documentation](URL) — Core concepts and getting started
- 📖 [API/CLI Reference](URL) — Command syntax and options
- 📖 [Best Practices Guide](URL) — Patterns and recommendations (optional third link)

---

## �️ Visual Assets

*Optional but highly recommended: Include diagrams, screenshots, and visual aids from source documentation*

### When to Include Images

- **Architecture diagrams** — System structure, component relationships, data flow
- **Screenshots** — CLI output, UI features, configuration panels
- **Flow charts** — Process workflows, decision trees, execution sequences
- **Before/After comparisons** — Visual proof of improvements or changes

### Image Organization

Store images in local `images/` subdirectory:

```
tech-talks/
  your-talk-name/
    README.md
    images/
      architecture-overview.png
      cli-example-output.png
      workflow-diagram.svg
```

### Image Guidelines

- **Prefer SVG** for diagrams (scalable, small file size)
- **Use descriptive filenames** — `workflow-diagram.svg` not `image1.svg`
- **Include alt text** — Describe what the image shows for accessibility
- **Keep images focused** — Crop to relevant portions, avoid full-page screenshots
- **Optimize file size** — Resize to reasonable dimensions (1200px width max)
- **Credit sources** — Note origin if from external documentation

### Example Usage in Content

```markdown
![Architecture Overview](images/architecture-overview.png)
*Figure: Core components and their interactions*

![CLI Output Example](images/cli-example-output.png)
*Example: Running `copilot -p "analyze logs"` shows structured output*
```

**For Authors:** Images extracted during tech-talk generation are downloaded to `images/` directory automatically. Review for quality and relevance before publishing.

---

## �📦 Key Artifacts

**Every tech talk must include working artifacts.** These are the actual files, configurations, or code samples that demonstrate the feature in action.

### Primary Artifacts

*These are shown inline with detailed explanation in the major sections below*

- **`[filename]`** — [One-line purpose, e.g., "GitHub Actions workflow for automated triage"]
- **`[filename]`** — [One-line purpose, e.g., "Configuration file with prompt templates"]
- **`[filename]`** — [One-line purpose, e.g., "Example script demonstrating core pattern"]

### Supporting Files

*Available in repository for download/reference*

- **[`/examples/`](examples/)** — Complete working examples you can copy
- **[`setup-guide.md`](setup-guide.md)** — Step-by-step installation and configuration
- **[`troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md)** — Common issues and solutions (optional)

**Guidance for Authors:**
- Primary artifacts (2-5 files) are the "stars of the show" — embedded fully in major sections with explanations
- Supporting files are helpers — linked for reference, not explained line-by-line
- Inline artifacts typically ≤ 150 lines; longer files should be in repository with key excerpts shown
- Every artifact should demonstrate a specific capability or pattern

### Slide-Friendly Writing Tips

- **Keep bullet points to 5 or fewer** per section (slides will split if more)
- **Use comparison tables** instead of long paragraphs where possible
- **Break long code examples** into separate subsections
- **Mark major sections** with 🎬 comment so TOC generates correctly
- **Front-load key points** in each section (becomes slide title/summary)
- **Use concrete metrics** in outcomes ("3x faster" not "much faster")

### Voice and Tone

- **Respectful of audience expertise**: Assume readers are professionals
- **Practical over theoretical**: Focus on "here's how" not "here's why it's interesting"
- **Honest about tradeoffs**: Acknowledge limitations and alternative approaches
- **Directive without being prescriptive**: Guide decisions, don't mandate solutions

## Example: Filled-In Template Snippet

*Remove this section before publishing - it's here to show what good content looks like*

### Example: Mental Model Shift Section

> **The Core Insight:** From "AI assists me with coding" to "AI autonomously completes work while I govern outcomes"

#### Move Toward (Embrace These Patterns)

- ✅ **Delegation Over Instruction**: Give agents goals and constraints, let them determine approach → Agents find solutions you wouldn't have considered
- ✅ **Outcome-Based Review**: Judge results by correctness and quality, not by how it was built → Faster iteration cycles, less micromanagement
- ✅ **Parallel Workflows**: Run multiple agents on different branches simultaneously → 5-10x throughput on independent features

#### Move Away From (Retire These Habits)

- ⚠️ **Step-by-Step Prompting**: Telling AI exactly what to do at each step → Negates AI's reasoning abilities, wastes your time
- ⚠️ **Single-File Focus**: Only giving AI context about the immediate file → Misses architectural patterns, creates inconsistent code
- ⚠️ **Sequential Execution**: Waiting for one task to finish before starting next → Leaves agents idle, extends delivery timelines

#### Move Against (Active Resistance Required)

- 🛑 **"AI Can't Be Trusted" Mindset**: Assuming AI output is always wrong until proven right → Creates review bottlenecks, defeats purpose of automation
- 🛑 **No Guardrails**: Running agents with full system access without sandboxing → Security incidents, accidental deletions, configuration overwrites

> **Example Transformation:** Before: Developer spends 3 hours writing a new API endpoint, 2 hours writing tests, 1 hour updating docs. After: Developer writes issue describing endpoint requirements, assigns to Copilot agent, reviews PR 30 minutes later with implementation + tests + docs complete.
