## 🧱 The Foundation: Chat + Primitives

Every Copilot journey starts with two essentials:

| Step | Talk | Why it matters |
|------|------|----------------|
| **1. Learn to talk to Copilot** | [Copilot Chat](copilot-chat/) | Master context mechanisms — #file, @workspace, #codebase |
| **2. Teach Copilot your codebase** | [Copilot Primitives](copilot-primitives/) | The 4 configuration primitives (instructions, prompts, skills, agents) that transform Copilot from a generic assistant into a team-specific development partner |

> 💡 **Everything else builds on these two.** Chat teaches you how to collaborate with Copilot. Primitives teaches you how to configure Copilot to work the way your team needs. Start here regardless of role.

## 🚀 Quick Start (After the Foundation)

| I want to... | Go to |
|--------------|-------|
| Understand how Copilot works under the hood | [Copilot Chat Internals](copilot-chat-internals/) — debug view, system prompts |
| Use Copilot in the terminal | [Copilot CLI](copilot-cli/) — natural language to shell, Plan Mode |
| Use Copilot in the browser | [Copilot Web](copilot-web/) — cross-device, PR reviews, issue triage |
| Integrate Copilot into any editor or tool | [Copilot ACP](copilot-acp/) — Agent Client Protocol for universal AI integration |
| Embed Copilot in my own apps | [Copilot SDK](copilot-sdk/) — programmatic agent integration |
| Get quick wins with agents | [Agentic Journey](agentic-journey/) — issue-to-PR automation in hours |
| Implement agent safety controls | [Terminal Sandboxing](terminal-sandboxing/) + [Copilot Hooks](copilot-hooks/) |

## 📊 Comparison Tables

### Copilot Interfaces

| Interface | Best For | Talk |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **VS Code Chat** | Interactive development, complex tasks, exploration | [Copilot Chat](copilot-chat/) |
| **Terminal (CLI)** | DevOps automation, Plan Mode, scripting | [Copilot CLI](copilot-cli/) |
| **Browser/Mobile** | Cross-device, lightweight queries, web workflows | [Copilot Web](copilot-web/) |
| **Any Editor (ACP)** | Universal agent access, custom tools, multi-agent systems | [Copilot ACP](copilot-acp/) |
| **Programmatic (SDK)** | Custom apps, embedded agents, specialized tools | [Copilot SDK](copilot-sdk/) |

### Agent Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Talk |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Multi-Step Tasks** | Phased work needing context isolation (research → analysis → implementation) | [Multi-Step Tasks](multi-step-tasks/) |
| **Agent Teams** | Specialized roles working together (planner / coder / reviewer) | [Agent Teams](agent-teams/) |
| **Parallel Execution** | Independent features running simultaneously on different branches | [Parallel Execution](parallel-execution/) |

### Governance Controls

| Tool | Controls | Talk |
|------|----------|------|
| **Terminal Sandboxing** | _What_ agents can access — network, filesystem restrictions | [Terminal Sandboxing](terminal-sandboxing/) |
| **Copilot Hooks** | _When_ agents act — lifecycle gates, approval policies, audit trails | [Copilot Hooks](copilot-hooks/) |

💡 **Defense in depth:** Use both together — sandboxing for baseline safety, hooks for policy enforcement.

### Agentic Transformation Stages

| Stage | Scope | Talk | Expected ROI |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Try agents** | Issue triage automation | [Agentic Journey](agentic-journey/) (Phase 1) | 6× faster triage |
| **Automate workflows** | Full issue-to-PR lifecycle | [Agentic Journey](agentic-journey/) (Phases 1-4) | 10-20× throughput |
| **Transform SDLC** | Repos, PRs, CI/CD for AI velocity | [Agentic SDLC](agentic-sdlc/) | 100× at scale |
| **Scale organization** | Enterprise-wide adoption | [Enterprise Patterns](enterprise-patterns/) | Measurable org ROI |
| **Need executive buy-in?** | Business case first | [Agentic Labor](../exec-talks/agentic-labor/) | — |
