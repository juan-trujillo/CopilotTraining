# FanHub Agent Skills Library

> Agent Skills teach GitHub Copilot domain-specific knowledge. This library contains skills for bug reproduction testing, product requirements, and FanHub development workflows.

## What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are specialized folders containing:
- `SKILL.md` file with instructions (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Optional scripts, examples, and resources
- Domain-specific knowledge Copilot loads when relevant

Skills are part of an [open standard](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) used by various AI coding assistants.

### Where Skills Live

| Location | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.github/skills/` | Project | Shared with everyone on the project |
| `~/.copilot/skills/` | Personal | Available in all your projects |

### Skills vs Instructions vs Prompts

| Feature | Instructions | Prompts | Skills |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Loaded** | Always | Manually invoked | Automatically when relevant |
| **Scope** | Broad standards | Specific templates | Specialized tasks |
| **Contains** | Guidelines | Structured queries | Instructions + scripts + examples |
| **Best for** | Team conventions | Repeatable workflows | Domain expertise |

## FanHub Skills Library

This library contains three production-ready skills for FanHub development. Each skill is stored in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io).

### 1. Bug Reproduction Test Generator

**Location**: `bug-reproduction-test-generator/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: Generates failing tests that reproduce reported bugs in FanHub. Follows test-driven debugging principles—write a failing test first, then fix the bug.

**Key Features**:
- Bug reproduction test structure (describe/it blocks, Arrange/Act/Assert)
- Common bug categories (data integrity, null references, query errors, business logic)
- FanHub schema knowledge for realistic test data
- Test patterns that demonstrate the bug exists (should FAIL initially)

**Use this when**: A bug report comes in, reproducing issues before fixing them, preventing regression, or debugging data integrity problems.

### 2. Feature Requirements

**Location**: `feature-requirements/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: Product requirements for FanHub features. Ensures features meet product standards for error handling, UX, analytics, accessibility, and responsive design.

**Key Features**:
- Error handling patterns (boundaries, async errors, user-friendly messages)
- User feedback requirements (loading states, notifications, confirmations)
- Analytics tracking conventions
- Accessibility standards (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Responsive design guidelines

**Use this when**: Creating new pages/routes, building React components, implementing user interactions, or adding forms.

### 3. API Endpoint Design

**Location**: `api-endpoint-design/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: REST API design standards for FanHub's Express backend.

**Key Features**:
- URL conventions (lowercase, plural nouns, nested routes, versioning)
- HTTP method guidelines
- Response format standards (success/error structures)
- Status code usage
- Complete endpoint template

**Use this when**: Creating or modifying API endpoints to ensure consistency across the backend.

## Skills Library Strategy

### Ownership

| Skill | Owner | Last Review |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| bug-reproduction-test-generator | Elena | [Date] |
| feature-requirements | Rafael | [Date] |
| api-endpoint-design | David | [Date] |

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Monthly**: Review skills for accuracy
- **Quarterly**: Update with new patterns/requirements
- **On-demand**: Update when underlying standards change

### Testing Skills

Verify skills work correctly:

```
@workspace Create a new character object for Eleven from Stranger Things

# Expected: Copilot applies bug-reproduction-test-generator skill automatically
# and includes all required fields with proper validation
```
