# Exercise 3.3: Lore Entry Accuracy Check Prompt

### Exercise 3.3: Lore Entry Accuracy Check Prompt — "Encode Your Domain Knowledge"

**Lead:** Marcus ⭐ | **Support:** Sarah 🤝 | **Time:** 12 min

#### 📖 The Challenge

It's 10:20 AM. Marcus just opened a PR — he used Copilot to batch-generate lore entries for the `/lore` page the team built last sprint. Ten facts about the show, fifteen minutes of work. The code looks fine.

Sarah reviews it. One entry says Walter White first met Jesse "at a university chemistry program." He didn't — Walter was Jesse's high school chemistry teacher at J.P. Wynne High School. She keeps reading. A second entry misattributes a quote. A third has the wrong location.

She finds three errors. She flags them. She is not doing this every sprint.

*"Marcus. You used Copilot to write these entries. You need to use Copilot to check them. The canon rules are sitting in `docs/breaking-bad-universe.md` from Module 1. Build a prompt that validates lore entries — before anything goes into the database."*

Marcus blinks. He tab-switches to Hacker News. Then he tab-switches back.

*"Wait — if the rules are already in the file, I just... point the prompt at each entry? Before it hits the database?"*

That's exactly it. The knowledge exists. The prompt just makes it run consistently, at scale, by anyone on the team.

#### 🔄 The Transformation

| Before ❌ | After ✨ |
|-----------|----------|
| Marcus ships Copilot-generated lore entries; Sarah manually cross-references canon during PR review. | Marcus invokes `/lore-accuracy-check` before opening the PR. Canon errors are caught before Sarah ever sees the code. |
| **Review time:** 8–10 min/PR, entirely on Sarah | **Review time:** ~2 min — Marcus reads the prompt output, fixes before pushing |
| **Error catch rate:** Varies by Sarah's availability and recall | **Error catch rate:** 100% for rules encoded in the universe file |
| **Scale:** Sarah is the bottleneck on every lore PR | **Scale:** Any team member runs the check; the domain knowledge lives in a file |

**Time saved:** 7 min avg × 20 lore reviews/sprint = **140 min/sprint** = **60 hours/year**. More importantly: Sarah stops being the accuracy bottleneck for lore Marcus generates.

#### 🎯 Your Goal

Create `.github/prompts/lore-accuracy-check.prompt.md` — a reusable prompt that validates any lore entry against the canon rules in your universe file. The prompt should catch errors in lore descriptions, pass cleanly on correct content, and work on any lore entry without being hardcoded to a specific title or character.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Scaffold the prompt file in Agent mode**

   In GitHub Copilot Chat, switch to **Agent mode**. Paste the following to generate the initial prompt file:

   ```
   Create a new prompt file at `.github/prompts/lore-accuracy-check.prompt.md`.

   The prompt should:
   - Have frontmatter with name, description, and mode: ask
   - Reference `docs/[show]-universe.md` as its accuracy source using a `#file:` reference
   - Instruct Copilot to check provided lore entry content against canon rules
   - Flag anything that contradicts show canon, misattributes relationships or locations, or
     makes claims not established in the show
   - List specific rule violations if any are found
   - Pass cleanly (with a brief confirmation) when no violations are detected
   - Use ${selection} so it operates on selected text, or instruct the user to paste content after invoking it
   ```

   **For other shows:** Replace `breaking-bad` and the reference to `docs/breaking-bad-universe.md` with your show's slug and universe file path (e.g., `docs/stranger-things-universe.md`).

2. **Review and refine the prompt body**

   Open the generated `.github/prompts/lore-accuracy-check.prompt.md`. It should look roughly like this — adjust yours if it doesn't:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: lore-accuracy-check
   description: 'Validates lore entries for accuracy against show canon rules'
   mode: ask
   ---

   You are a canon accuracy reviewer for a fan site.

   Check the following lore entry against the established canon in
   [docs/[show]-universe.md](../docs/[show]-universe.md).

   Content to review:
   ${selection}

   For each violation found:
   - Quote the problematic text
   - Explain what the canon rule says
   - Suggest a corrected version

   If no violations are found, confirm the content is accurate and briefly explain why it passes.

   Do not flag stylistic choices or tone — only factual contradictions with established canon.
   ```

   **Key design decisions to preserve:**
   - **`#file:` or markdown link to the universe file** — this is what makes the prompt accurate. Without it, the prompt is generic and Copilot will fall back on training data, which may contain the same errors you're trying to catch.
   - **`${selection}`** — lets you select text in the editor and invoke the prompt against it, rather than copy-pasting into chat manually.
   - **No hardcoded entry titles** — the prompt works on any lore entry. Don't constrain it to a specific title or character name.
   - **Separate factual from stylistic** — the last line is important. Without it, the prompt may flag valid creative choices as errors.

3. **Test against a known-bad lore entry**

   The FanHub seed data contains a deliberately wrong lore entry. Use this as your test input — either select it in the editor and invoke the prompt, or paste it directly in chat after invoking `/lore-accuracy-check`:

   ```
   Title: "Walter & Jesse — Origin"
   Walter White recruited Jesse Pinkman as his partner after reconnecting with him on
   the street. Jesse had been Walter's former student at the University of New Mexico,
   where Walter taught a chemistry course.
   ```

   **Expected result:** The prompt should flag "University of New Mexico" as a canon violation. Walter White was a chemistry teacher at J.P. Wynne **High School** — not a university professor. The corrected version should reference J.P. Wynne High School.

   If the prompt doesn't catch this, check that your universe file (from Exercise 1.6) correctly states Walter's role and that the prompt file actually references it. The prompt is only as accurate as the rules you encoded.

4. **Test against a correct lore entry — confirm it passes cleanly**

   Now test an accurate lore entry to confirm the prompt doesn't generate false positives:

   ```
   Title: "The Blue Sky Formula"
   Walter White's methamphetamine, known on the street as "Blue Sky," achieved a purity
   level exceeding 99% — far beyond any competitor. Its distinctive blue tint came from
   the synthesis method Walter developed at the Superlab.
   ```

   **Expected result:** The prompt should confirm this passes — the key facts (purity over 99%, the Superlab) are consistent with established canon.

5. **Test on your own show's content (non-Breaking Bad participants)**

   If you're building a site for a different show, write one intentionally wrong lore entry and one accurate one from your show, then run both through your show's accuracy-check prompt.

   **Stranger Things example (wrong):**
   ```
   Eleven's psychokinetic powers were the result of her mother's exposure
   to LSD during CIA experiments conducted at Hawkins Lab.
   ```
   *(The show depicts MKUltra-style experiments, but the specific mechanism for Eleven's powers is tied to her mother Teresa's participation — test whether your prompt correctly handles this level of canon nuance.)*

   The goal is the same: one failure case, one passing case. The prompt should distinguish between them using only the rules in your universe file.

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] `.github/prompts/lore-accuracy-check.prompt.md` exists with correct frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `mode: ask`)
- [ ] The prompt references `docs/[show]-universe.md` using a `#file:` reference or markdown link
- [ ] The prompt is invokable in Copilot Chat as `/[show]-accuracy-check`
- [ ] The prompt catches the "former college student" error (or equivalent error for your show)
- [ ] The prompt passes cleanly on the correctly-described Walter White bio (or equivalent for your show)
- [ ] The prompt works on any content type — not hardcoded to a specific character or field

## 🔗 What You Built

**In this exercise:**
- `.github/prompts/[show]-accuracy-check.prompt.md` — A reusable canon accuracy checker that applies the rules from your universe file to any content piece on demand

**How it compounds:**

| Previous Modules | This Exercise | Combined Power |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Exercise 1.6: `docs/[show]-universe.md` with canon rules | Prompt that references and applies those rules | Domain knowledge encoded once → applied systematically at every content review |
| Exercise 3.1: Test-generation prompt | Accuracy-check prompt | Two audit layers: code correctness (tests) + content correctness (canon check) |
| Exercise 3.2: Context-aware prompt with linked docs | Universe file as the linked source of truth | The pattern generalizes: any structured knowledge file can become an accuracy prompt's reference |

**Why this matters:** Elena's insight — "I already wrote the rules; I just hadn't automated their application" — describes a real and recurring problem on AI-assisted teams. Domain experts encode knowledge in documents. That knowledge sits idle unless it's wired into the workflows that need it. Prompt files are the wire. The fan site makes this concrete: the same pattern applies to clinical terminology validation in healthcare, regulatory compliance checking in fintech, brand voice auditing in e-commerce. **You don't just write the rules once — you build the check that applies them every time.**

## ➡️ Next Module

**[Module 4: Agent Skills](../04-agent-skills/README.md)** — You've built prompts that apply domain knowledge on demand. Next: package that knowledge into agent skills that Copilot can call proactively, without being explicitly invoked — so the accuracy check happens as part of the workflow, not after it.

> *"The prompt catches errors when Elena remembers to run it. What I want is a skill that runs as part of content generation — so the check is baked in, not bolted on."*
> — David, about to build the lore validation skill
