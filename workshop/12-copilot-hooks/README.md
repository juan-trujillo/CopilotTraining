# Module 12: Copilot Hooks

## ⏰ 5:00 PM — The Governance Problem

> _"We shipped feature flags, deployment checks, and a full test suite. But if Copilot can edit any file and run any command, how do we enforce security policies, audit compliance, or catch dangerous operations before they happen?"_  
> — Sarah, realizing AI agents need guardrails just like human developers

---

## 📖 Story So Far

In **Module 1**, the team added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to give Copilot project-level context...

In **Module 4**, they created `.github/instructions` files for role-specific guidance...

In **Module 5**, they built Agent Skills for domain-specific operations...

In **Module 7**, they created custom agents for complex workflows...

Now, in **Module 12**, they face the governance challenge: **How do we validate, audit, and control what AI agents can do?** Copilot can create, edit, and run commands—but in regulated environments or with junior team members, you need quality gates, security policies, and compliance logging.

💡 **Integration Note:** This module builds on the entire customization stack by adding **control points** at critical moments—session start, before tool use, after tool execution, and on errors. Hooks turn your repository from "AI can suggest anything" to "AI operates within approved boundaries."

---

⚠️ **Prerequisites**:

- Complete [Module 00: Orientation](../00-orientation/README.md)
- Understanding of shell scripting (Bash or PowerShell)
- Familiarity with JSON parsing (using `jq` or similar)
- Optional: Review [Module 4: Custom Instructions](../04-custom-instructions/README.md) for context on repository customization

## 🧠 Mindful Moment: Automation with Accountability

**Traditional thinking:** _"If I automate something, I lose visibility and control over what happens."_

**AI-native thinking:** _"Hooks let me automate with programmable oversight—agents move fast but within defined boundaries."_

This isn't about distrusting AI—it's about **governance at scale**. Just as you wouldn't let developers commit directly to production without CI checks, you shouldn't let agents operate without validation hooks. The goal: **velocity with visibility**.

💡 **Understanding Hooks**

**Hooks** are custom shell commands that execute at key points in Copilot agent sessions. Think of them as **lifecycle events** with programmable handlers:

- **sessionStart** — Initialize environments, validate project state
- **userPromptSubmitted** — Log user requests for audit trails
- **preToolUse** — Approve or deny tool executions (most powerful)
- **postToolUse** — Track results, collect metrics, send alerts
- **errorOccurred** — Handle failures, notify teams, log debugging info
- **sessionEnd** — Cleanup resources, archive logs, send reports

Each hook receives **JSON input** via stdin with context (timestamp, working directory, tool name, arguments, results) and can optionally return **JSON output** to control behavior (e.g., `{"permissionDecision": "deny"}`).

**Key capabilities:**

- Block dangerous commands before execution
- Enforce directory/file restrictions
- Audit every agent action for compliance
- Integrate with external systems (Slack, metrics platforms)
- Collect usage statistics for cost tracking

**Why it matters for this module:** The `preToolUse` hook is essential because it's the only interception point where you can **prevent** (not just log) actions. This enables real-time governance that makes AI agents safe for regulated environments.

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Hook Lifecycle and Execution Flow

Hooks execute synchronously at specific points in the agent's workflow. When an event occurs (like the user submitting a prompt or the agent attempting to use a tool), Copilot:

1. Invokes the corresponding hook script
2. Passes event data as JSON to the script's stdin
3. Waits for the script to complete (up to `timeoutSec`, default 30s)
4. For `preToolUse` hooks, reads the output to determine permission
5. Continues agent execution based on the result

**Session Hooks**

- **Purpose**: Manage session lifecycle, initialize/cleanup environments
- **Value**: Ensures consistent state, prevents resource leaks
- **Result**: Reliable agent sessions with proper setup/teardown
- **What to include**: Environment validation, logging configuration, resource allocation
- **What NOT to include**: Long-running operations (keep under 5 seconds), blocking operations that delay agent response

**Audit and Logging Hooks**

- **Purpose**: Record agent actions for compliance and analysis
- **Value**: Provides evidence for audits, enables usage tracking
- **Result**: Complete audit trail of what agents did and when
- **What to include**: Structured logging (JSON Lines), timestamps, user/action/result
- **What NOT to include**: Sensitive data (tokens, passwords), unstructured text logs

**Control Hooks (preToolUse)**

- **Purpose**: Validate and approve/deny tool executions in real-time
- **Value**: Prevents dangerous operations, enforces security policies
- **Result**: Agents operate safely within defined boundaries
- **What to include**: Pattern matching for dangerous commands, directory restrictions, policy checks
- **What NOT to include**: Complex business logic (keep hooks fast), operations with side effects

### How They Work Together

A typical governance workflow combines multiple hook types:

1. **sessionStart**: Validate project is in clean state, initialize log file
2. **userPromptSubmitted**: Log user's request for audit trail
3. **preToolUse**: Check if tool execution meets security/compliance policies
   - If denied: Return `{"permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}`
   - If allowed: Log approval and continue
4. **postToolUse**: Record result (success/failure), collect metrics
5. **errorOccurred**: If anything fails, log error details and alert team
6. **sessionEnd**: Archive logs, send summary report

## 📚 What This Feature Does

**Copilot Hooks:** Custom shell commands that execute at strategic points in agent sessions (start, end, before/after tool use, on error), receiving JSON context via stdin and optionally controlling agent behavior via JSON output.

**When to use it:** When you need governance, security enforcement, compliance logging, or quality gates that validate agent actions in real-time—not just after the fact.

**What you'll build:**

- **Security Policy Hook** — Blocks dangerous commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, destructive operations) before execution
- **Audit Trail System** — Logs every agent session, prompt, and tool use to JSON Lines format for compliance reporting
- **Quality Gate Hook** — Runs linters/formatters before code changes are applied, enforcing standards at the point of creation

**Official Documentation:**

- 📖 [About hooks](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-hooks) — Conceptual overview and types of hooks
- 📖 [Hooks configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-configuration) — Complete reference with hook types, input/output formats, and advanced patterns
- 📖 [Using hooks with GitHub Copilot agents](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/use-hooks) — Step-by-step guide for creating and troubleshooting hooks

> 💡 **Important for this module:** The `preToolUse` hook is essential because it's the only hook that can **prevent** actions (via `permissionDecision: "deny"`). All other hooks are observational—they can log, alert, and collect metrics, but only `preToolUse` provides real-time control. This enables "AI with guardrails" rather than "AI with post-incident review."

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes

_For those who want to understand the deeper mechanics:_

### How Hook Execution Works

When Copilot coding agent encounters a hook event:

1. **Event Detection**: Agent detects lifecycle event (session start, tool use request, etc.)
2. **Hook Discovery**: Reads `.github/hooks/*.json` files from repository's default branch
3. **Script Invocation**: Spawns shell process (`bash` or `powershell` depending on OS)
4. **Context Passing**: Writes JSON payload to script's stdin with event data
5. **Execution**: Waits for script completion (up to `timeoutSec`)
6. **Output Parsing**: For `preToolUse`, reads stdout looking for JSON `permissionDecision`
7. **Action**: Either proceeds (allow/no output) or aborts (deny) based on hook response

**Key Takeaway:** Hooks run **synchronously** in the agent's execution path. Keep them fast (<5 seconds ideal) to avoid degrading agent responsiveness. Use background processing for expensive operations.

### Why JSON Lines for Logging

Traditional log formats require parsing logic to extract structured data. **JSON Lines (`.jsonl`)** writes one JSON object per line, enabling:

- **Direct query**: `grep '"toolName":"bash"' audit.jsonl | jq .`
- **Append safety**: No risk of corrupting existing JSON structure
- **Streaming analysis**: Process logs incrementally without loading entire file
- **Tool compatibility**: Works with `jq`, `sqlite`, log aggregation platforms

**Example:**

```bash
# Count tool usage by type
cat logs/audit.jsonl | jq -r '.toolName' | sort | uniq -c

# Find all denied operations
cat logs/audit.jsonl | jq 'select(.permissionDecision == "deny")'

# Export to CSV for reporting
cat logs/audit.jsonl | jq -r '[.timestamp, .toolName, .result] | @csv'
```

### Hook Performance and Timeouts

Hooks have a default 30-second timeout, but this doesn't mean they should take that long:

- **Target: <2 seconds** for most hooks (security checks, logging)
- **Maximum: 5 seconds** for operations users will wait for (linting)
- **Use `timeoutSec: 120`** only for expensive operations (external API calls, complex validation)

**Performance tips:**

- Cache results of expensive computations
- Use asynchronous logging (append to file, don't wait for I/O)
- Offload slow work to background jobs triggered by hooks
- Profile scripts to find bottlenecks: `time ./my-hook.sh < test-input.json`
