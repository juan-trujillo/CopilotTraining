# Exercise 6.3: Create Implementation Agent for Feature Spec Execution

## 🎯 Objective

Create a `@implement` custom agent with full editing tools and API design skill that takes fully-formed Feature Specs and implements them correctly and thoroughly, with handoff to character review.

> **Note:** This exercise creates an autonomous implementation agent that reads feature specifications (Feature Specs) and executes them end-to-end, demonstrating how agents can work from existing documentation rather than requiring live planning sessions.

**Lead:** Sarah ⭐ | **Support:** Marcus 🤝, David 🤝

## 📖 The Story

### ❌ The "Before" — Manual Feature Spec Implementation

**Monday 4:15 PM** — Sarah has a fully-formed Feature Spec at [FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md](../../fanhub/docs/FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md) that specifies exactly what needs to be built. Now she needs to implement it.

**Current workflow:**
1. Opens the Feature Spec document manually
2. Reads through all requirements and implementation details
3. Manually searches for related files with `@workspace`
4. Starts implementing, frequently alt-tabbing back to Feature Spec
5. Forgets which API patterns to use—searches through existing routes
6. Implements frontend, then realizes backend wasn't complete—goes back
7. Misses a required test file mentioned in Feature Spec
8. After implementation, manually asks Copilot to review for security

**Time breakdown:**
- **8 minutes** — Reading Feature Spec, searching related files, remembering implementation order
- **Incomplete first pass** — 40% chance of missing a component (forgot backend route, forgot test, forgot database migration)
- **No systematic approach** — Ad-hoc implementation order leads to rework
- **Manual review follow-up** — Separate workflow after completion

David observes: "You have a perfect specification in that Feature Spec. What if an implementation agent could read it, plan the execution order, implement everything systematically, and then hand off to character review automatically?"

---

### ✨ The "After" — Feature Spec-Driven Implementation Agent

**The transformation:**

Sarah creates `.github/agents/implement.agent.md` with:
- **Full editing tools** — `['edit', 'create', 'delete', 'search', 'fetch', 'githubRepo', 'usages']`
- **API design skill** — Auto-loads `.github/skills/api-endpoint-design/` for backend work
- **Feature Spec-reading instructions** — Analyze Feature Spec structure, identify all components, implement systematically
- **Handoff to character-review** — Automatic workflow to review character-detail changes after implementation

**New workflow:**
1. Types: `@implement Read fanhub/docs/FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md and implement the complete feature`
2. Agent reads Feature Spec, identifies all components (frontend, backend, database, tests)
3. Agent implements systematically in correct order (database → backend → frontend → tests)
4. Agent follows API design patterns automatically
5. After completion, clicks "Review Character Change" handoff button
6. Switches to `@character-review` agent with changes pre-loaded

**Results:**
- **Setup time**: 8→0 minutes (agent reads Feature Spec and plans execution)
- **Completeness**: 60%→100% (agent checks Feature Spec for all required components)
- **Systematic approach**: Always implements in correct order (database → backend → frontend → tests)
- **Integrated workflow**: Character review is part of the process, not afterthought
- **First-time-right**: 40%→85% (comprehensive Feature Spec reading reduces missed components)

### 💭 Sarah's Realization

> *"This changes how I think about implementation. The Feature Spec is the source of truth—complete, reviewed, approved. The implementation agent treats it like a detailed specification and executes it systematically. I'm not constantly context-switching between the doc and code. And the handoff to character review makes quality checks part of the workflow, not something I remember to do later. This is how implementation should work: from spec to code to review, all orchestrated."*

## 🔨 Steps

### Step 1: Create Implementation Agent Configuration

**Context:** The `@implement` agent needs full editing capabilities and should systematically execute feature specifications from Feature Spec documents. It hands off to character review after implementation.

**Task:**

1. Create `.github/agents/implement.agent.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
description: Implement features from Feature Specs with full editing capabilities
name: Implement
tools: ['edit', 'create', 'delete', 'search', 'fetch', 'githubRepo', 'usages', 'problems']
model: Claude Sonnet 4
handoffs:
  - label: Review Character Change
    agent: character-review
    prompt: Review the character detail change and tell me what tests, edge cases, duplicate-data risks, or follow-up work we need before opening the PR.
    send: false

# Implementation Mode Instructions

You are an IMPLEMENTATION AGENT specialized in executing feature specifications from Feature Specs.

**You have full editing capabilities:** create files, modify code, delete obsolete code. Use these responsibly by following the Feature Spec specification closely.

## Feature Spec-Driven Implementation Workflow

When given an Feature Spec or feature specification document:

### 1. Read and Analyze the Feature Spec

- **Load the complete document** — Read the entire Feature Spec to understand scope
- **Identify all components** — List frontend, backend, database, test requirements
- **Note dependencies** — Understand what needs to be implemented in what order
- **Check acceptance criteria** — Know what "done" looks like

### 2. Plan Execution Order

Systematically implement in this order:

1. **Database schema** — Migrations and model changes first (foundation)
2. **Backend API** — Routes, controllers, business logic
3. **Frontend components** — UI implementation consuming the API
4. **Tests** — Unit tests, integration tests as specified in Feature Spec
5. **Documentation** — Update relevant docs if required

**Why this order?** Backend depends on database. Frontend depends on backend. Tests verify everything. This minimizes rework.

### 3. Implement Systematically

For each component:

- **Search for related code** — Use `@workspace` to find similar patterns
- **Follow repository standards** — Reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Use available skills** — If API design skill is available, apply those patterns
- **Check for existing errors** — Use `problems` tool to avoid introducing regressions
- **Create complete implementations** — Don't leave TODOs or placeholders unless Feature Spec specifies them

### 4. Verify Completeness

Before finishing:

- **Cross-check against Feature Spec** — Did you implement everything specified?
- **Review acceptance criteria** — Does implementation meet all criteria?
- **Check file references** — Did you create/modify all mentioned files?
- **Consider edge cases** — Does implementation handle error scenarios from Feature Spec?

## FanHub Implementation Patterns

**Architecture:** React frontend → Express backend → PostgreSQL database

**Common implementation order:**
1. Update `backend/src/database/schema.sql` for database changes
2. Create/update route in `backend/src/routes/*.js`
3. Create/update component in `frontend/src/components/` or `frontend/src/pages/`
4. Create tests in `backend/__tests__/` and `frontend/__tests__/`

**Key skills to reference:**
- `api-endpoint-design` — For backend route patterns
- Repository instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — For coding standards

## Quality Standards

- **No placeholders** — Implement complete, working code
- **Follow existing patterns** — Match the style of similar components
- **Include error handling** — Don't just implement happy path
- **Write meaningful tests** — Test the acceptance criteria from Feature Spec

## After Implementation

When implementation is complete, use the "Review Character Change" handoff to transition to the `@character-review` agent for quality verification.
```

### Step 2: Test Feature Spec-Driven Implementation

**Context:** Verify the `@implement` agent can read an Feature Spec, systematically implement all components, and hand off to character review.

**Task:**

1. Open Copilot Chat panel
2. Select **@implement** from the agent dropdown
3. Verify the chat input placeholder shows: "Implement features from Feature Specs with full editing capabilities"
4. Type this prompt:

```
Read fanhub/docs/FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md and implement the complete feature systematically:
- Database schema changes
- Backend API endpoints
- Frontend components
- Tests

Follow the Feature Spec specification exactly and implement in the correct order.
```

5. Observe the agent's workflow:
   - Reads the complete Feature Spec document
   - Identifies all required components (database, backend, frontend, tests)
   - Implements in systematic order (database → backend → frontend → tests)
   - Follows repository standards and API design patterns
   - Creates complete, working code (no TODOs or placeholders)
6. After implementation completes, verify a "Review Character Change" handoff button appears
7. Click "Review Character Change" to transition to `@character-review` agent
8. Verify the prompt is pre-filled: "Review the character detail change and tell me what tests, edge cases, duplicate-data risks, or follow-up work we need before opening the PR."

**Validation:**
- ✅ Agent reads and analyzes the full Feature Spec document
- ✅ Agent identifies all components (database, backend, frontend, tests)
- ✅ Implementation follows systematic order (dependencies first)
- ✅ Code is complete and follows repository patterns
- ✅ "Review Character Change" handoff button appears after implementation
- ✅ Handoff to character-review works with pre-filled prompt

---

### Step 3: Verify Completeness Against Feature Spec

**Context:** Ensure the implementation agent doesn't miss components specified in the Feature Spec.

**Task:**

1. Open [fanhub/docs/FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md](../../fanhub/docs/FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md)
2. Create a checklist of all specified components:
   - [ ] Database schema modifications
   - [ ] Backend API route
   - [ ] Frontend component(s)
   - [ ] Tests
   - [ ] Any other requirements from the Feature Spec
3. Review the code changes made by `@implement` agent
4. Check off each item that was implemented
5. Note any missing components

**Validation:**
- ✅ 100% of Feature Spec-specified components are implemented
- ✅ Implementation follows the architecture pattern (database → backend → frontend → tests)
- ✅ No placeholders or TODO comments (complete implementation)
- ✅ Code follows repository standards from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
---

### Step 4: Compare Before and After Metrics

**Context:** Measure the improvement from Feature Spec-driven implementation versus manual implementation.

**Task:**

Document these comparisons:

**Before (Manual Feature Spec Implementation):**
- Setup time: 8 minutes (reading Feature Spec, searching files, remembering order)
- Completeness: 60% first-time-right (often miss components like tests or migrations)
- Implementation approach: Ad-hoc order leads to rework when dependencies missed
- Security review: Manual separate step, often forgotten until PR time

**After (Feature Spec-Driven Agent):**
- Setup time: 0 minutes (agent reads Feature Spec and plans execution automatically)
- Completeness: 100% (agent cross-checks all Feature Spec components before finishing)
- Implementation approach: Systematic order (database → backend → frontend → tests)
- Character review: Integrated via handoff, part of workflow

**Key improvements:**
- **8→0 minutes** setup and planning time
- **60%→100%** first-time completeness (no missed components)
- **Systematic execution** always in correct dependency order
- **Integrated quality** character review is automatic next step via handoff
- **Feature Spec as contract** implementation agent treats Feature Spec as source of truth

**Validation:** You can articulate how Feature Spec-driven implementation:
- Eliminates context switching between documentation and code
- Ensures all specified components are implemented
- Follows systematic execution order based on dependencies
- Integrates character review into the workflow via handoffs

## 🚀 Challenge Extension

**Enhance the implementation workflow:**

1. **Bi-directional handoffs** — Add handoff from `@character-review` back to `@implement` for cases where review finds issues that should be fixed immediately

---

## 🚀 Challenge Extension

**Enhance the implementation agent:**

1. **Database-first validation** — Add instructions to always check if database schema changes are needed before implementing backend routes (prevent "forgot the migration" mistakes)

2. **Test-alongside-code** — Configure agent to generate tests immediately after implementing each component (database tests → backend tests → frontend tests) rather than all tests at the end

3. **Feature Spec template support** — If your team uses multiple Feature Spec formats, create variants: `@implement-feature` for features, `@implement-bugfix` for bugs, `@implement-refactor` for refactorings

4. **Skill composition** — Add multiple skills to `@implement` agent tools: `['api-endpoint-design/*', 'tv-show-data-validator/*']` to enable both API design and domain validation

---

## 📚 Key Concepts

**Feature Spec as source of truth:**
- Fully-formed specifications enable autonomous implementation
- Agent reads complete requirements, doesn't guess
- Systematic execution order based on dependencies
- Cross-checking against Feature Spec ensures completeness

**Execution order matters:**
- Database → Backend → Frontend → Tests
- Each layer depends on the previous one
- Implementing in order reduces rework
- Agent enforces this automatically

**Handoffs integrate workflows:**
- Implementation → Character Review creates quality workflow
- No manual "remember to review" step
- Pre-filled prompt carries context forward
- Quality checks become part of process, not afterthought

**Tool selection enables capabilities:**
- Implementation agent: full editing tools (`edit`, `create`, `delete`)
- `problems` tool: check for existing errors before implementing
- `usages` tool: find similar patterns to match
- Next agent (character-review): analysis tools without modification

**Systematic approach beats ad-hoc:**
- Agent always implements in correct order
- Checks Feature Spec for all components before finishing
- Follows repository standards automatically
- Reduces "oops, forgot the test" moments from 40% to near-zero

## 🔗 Module 6 Complete

You now have the core custom-agent workflow for the FanHub character arc:

1. **Understand agent design patterns** by studying the default `@plan` agent
2. **Create `@character-review`** to package the prompt, skill, and MCP-backed review workflow
3. **Create `@implement`** to execute Feature Spec-driven changes and hand off cleanly into review

> *"This is the version of Module 6 that matters: one agent to build, one agent to review, and a handoff between them so the workflow feels deliberate instead of improvised."*
> — Elena, seeing the full arc come together
