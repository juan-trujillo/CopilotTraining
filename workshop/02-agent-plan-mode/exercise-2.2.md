# Exercise 2.2: Validating and Refining Plans

## 🔨 Exercise

### Exercise 2.2: Validating and Refining Plans — "AI Proposes, Expertise Validates"

**Lead:** David ⭐ | **Support:** Elena 🤝, Sarah 🤝 | **Time:** 10 min

#### 📖 The Challenge

Marcus has a plan from Exercise 2.1, but here's the critical question: Is it production-ready? AI can analyze code patterns and propose plausible implementations, but it can't replace David's 20 years of architectural experience, Elena's quality instincts, or Sarah's standards enforcement.

David knows from experience: *"The plan covers the happy path, but what about error states? Caching invalidation? Race conditions during concurrent requests? AI gives us the 80% fast, but production readiness is in the remaining 20%."*

Before this workflow, the team discovered architectural issues during PR review—after code was written. That meant 2-3 review cycles per feature (45 minutes each) and sometimes complete refactoring. Catching issues during planning instead of implementation saves massive amounts of rework.

Elena adds: *"I also notice the plan doesn't mention test files. We need unit tests, integration tests, and API endpoint tests identified upfront, not as an afterthought."*

#### 🔄 The Transformation

| Before ❌ | After ✨ |
|-----------|----------|
| Accept AI plans at face value → implement → discover 3 architectural issues during PR review → refactor → 2-3 review cycles (45 min each) | Review plan with expertise → identify 3 issues during planning → refine plan → implement correctly the first time → 1 review cycle |
| **Architectural issues per feature:** 3<br>**Review cycles:** 2-3 (135 min total)<br>**Test planning:** Afterthought | **Architectural issues per feature:** 0<br>**Review cycles:** 1 (45 min total)<br>**Test planning:** Upfront |

#### 🎯 Your Goal

Apply architectural expertise to validate the AI-generated plan, identify gaps, and refine it before implementation.

#### 📋 Steps

1. **Review the Plan with Architectural Questions**
   
   Open the plan from Exercise 2.1 (`fanhub/docs/FEATURE-CHARACTER-DETAIL.md` or review it in the Chat view). Read through each implementation step while asking critical questions:
   
   **David's architectural lens:**
   - *Error handling:* What happens if character ID doesn't exist? Invalid format? Database timeout?
   - *Caching:* Should character data be cached? If yes, how do we invalidate cache on updates?
   - *Security:* Are we vulnerable to SQL injection? Does the API validate input?
   - *Performance:* Is the database query optimized? N+1 queries risk?
   - *Consistency:* Does this follow our existing error response patterns?
   
   **Elena's quality lens:**
   - *Testing:* Where are the test file modifications? Unit tests? Integration tests?
   - *Edge cases:* What about empty biographies? Characters with no episodes? Special characters in names?
   - *Test data:* Do we have test fixtures for character data?
   
   **Sarah's standards lens:**
   - *Patterns:* Does it follow our async/await conventions from copilot-instructions.md?
   - *File structure:* Are components in the right folders per ARCHITECTURE.md?
   - *Code style:* Will this pass our linting rules?
   
   Make notes of anything missing or concerning.

2. **Identify Gaps and Issues**
   
   Based on your review, list specific gaps. Here are examples you might find:
   
   **Architectural gaps:**
   - ❌ Plan doesn't mention error handling for invalid character IDs
   - ❌ No caching strategy defined (could hit database on every request)
   - ❌ Missing input validation on API endpoint
   
   **Quality gaps:**
   - ❌ No test files included in implementation steps
   - ❌ Edge cases not addressed (empty data, special characters)
   - ❌ No mention of test fixtures or mock data
   
   **Standards gaps:**
   - ❌ Response format might not match existing API patterns
   - ❌ Component structure unclear for styling consistency
   
   Write these down as **Plan Refinement Notes** in the plan document or in a comment in the chat.

3. **Refine the Plan Through Conversation**
   
   Return to the plan mode chat (where you generated the original plan). Stay in plan mode—don't switch to default chat yet. Add refinement requests:
   
   ```
   Update the plan to address these gaps:
   
   1. Add error handling for invalid character IDs (return 404 with standard error format)
   2. Include Redis caching layer with 5-minute TTL
   3. Add test file modifications:
      - backend/__tests__/routes/characters.test.js for API tests
      - frontend/__tests__/pages/CharacterDetail.test.jsx for component tests
   4. Add edge case handling for missing biography or zero episodes
   5. Ensure response format matches existing API patterns from backend/src/routes/shows.js
   ```
   
   **What to observe:** The plan agent regenerates the plan with your refinements incorporated. You should see:
   - New steps for error handling and caching
   - Test file paths added to implementation steps
   - Edge cases addressed with specific approaches
   - Reference to existing patterns for consistency
   
   This is the iterative refinement loop: propose → review → identify gaps → refine → repeat until confident.

4. **Validate the Refined Plan**
   
   Review the updated plan and verify:
   - [ ] All architectural concerns addressed (errors, caching, security, performance)
   - [ ] Test files explicitly included with paths and purposes
   - [ ] Edge cases mentioned with handling strategies
   - [ ] Standards and patterns from copilot-instructions.md followed
   - [ ] Dependencies still logical (database before API, API before frontend)
   
   Add a final note to the plan:
   
   ```markdown
   ## ✅ Plan Review Completed
   
   **Reviewed by:** David (Architecture), Elena (Quality), Sarah (Standards)
   **Issues identified:** 3 architectural gaps, 3 quality gaps
   **Resolution:** Plan refined to address all concerns
   **Status:** Approved for implementation
   ```
   
   Save the refined plan. Now it's production-ready, not just plausible.

#### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Plan reviewed through architectural, quality, and standards lenses
- [ ] At least 3 gaps identified (error handling, testing, edge cases, etc.)
- [ ] Plan refined with specific additions addressing each gap
- [ ] Test files explicitly included in implementation steps
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios documented with handling strategies
- [ ] Plan marked as reviewed and approved for implementation
