# Feature Specification: Character Detail Page

**Status:** 🟡 Planned (Not Yet Implemented)

**Internal Reference:** "The Golden Thread" (workshop tracking identifier)

---

## Overview

The Character Detail Page is a core feature for FanHub that allows users to explore comprehensive information about their favorite TV show characters. This page will serve as a deep-dive destination, providing character background, episode appearances, memorable quotes, relationships with other characters, and user interaction features.

**Why it matters:**
- **Engagement:** Character pages are high-value content that keeps users exploring
- **Discovery:** Helps fans discover connections and details they might have missed
- **Retention:** Favorite functionality creates personalized experiences that bring users back
- **SEO:** Character-specific pages improve search visibility for the platform

This feature represents the "golden thread" that ties together multiple technical concepts: component architecture, API design, state management, routing, and user interaction patterns.

## User Stories

### Primary Use Case
**As a fan**, I want to view detailed information about a specific character so that I can learn more about their background, see which episodes they appear in, read their memorable quotes, understand their relationships with other characters, and mark them as a favorite.

### Secondary Use Cases

**As a casual viewer**, I want to quickly understand who a character is and see their key moments, so I can decide if I want to watch episodes featuring them.

**As a dedicated fan**, I want to explore every detail about my favorite character, including all episode appearances and relationships, so I can fully appreciate their story arc.

**As a newcomer to the show**, I want to browse character profiles without major spoilers (when possible), so I can learn about the show while preserving my viewing experience.

**As a mobile user**, I want to access character details on my phone with fast load times and readable formatting, so I can look up information while watching.

### API Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/characters/:id`

**Response Shape:**
```json
{
  "id": "number",
  "name": "string",
  "bio": "string",
  "imageUrl": "string",
  "actor": {
    "name": "string",
    "imageUrl": "string (optional)"
  },
  "show": {
    "id": "number",
    "name": "string"
  },
  "episodes": [
    {
      "id": "number",
      "title": "string",
      "season": "number",
      "episodeNumber": "number",
      "airDate": "string (ISO 8601)"
    }
  ],
  "quotes": [
    {
      "text": "string",
      "episode": {
        "id": "number",
        "title": "string",
        "season": "number",
        "episodeNumber": "number"
      }
    }
  ],
  "relatedCharacters": [
    {
      "id": "number",
      "name": "string",
      "imageUrl": "string",
      "relationship": "string (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- 404 for non-existent character IDs
- 500 for server errors
- Graceful degradation for missing optional fields

### State Management

- **React Hooks:** Use `useState` for component-level state, `useEffect` for data fetching
- **React Router:** Use `useParams` to extract character ID from URL
- **localStorage API:** Store favorites as JSON array of character IDs
- **Custom Hook (optional):** `useFavorites()` to encapsulate favorite logic

### Routing

- **URL Pattern:** `/characters/:id`
- **Example:** `/characters/42`
- **Navigation:** Accessible from show pages, search results, and related character links

### Styling Approach

- Follow existing FanHub design patterns (see `frontend/src/styles/`)
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components (match project convention)
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Loading states with skeleton screens or spinners
- Error states with user-friendly messages

---

## Design Considerations

### Performance
- **Lazy Loading:** Load character image with `loading="lazy"` attribute
- **Code Splitting:** Consider lazy-loading the CharacterDetail component
- **Caching:** Implement client-side caching for recently viewed characters
- **Optimistic Updates:** For favorite toggle, update UI immediately before API call
- **Image Optimization:** Serve appropriately sized images for different viewports

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **ARIA Labels:** Descriptive labels for favorite button ("Add [Character Name] to favorites")
- **Alt Text:** Meaningful alt text for all images
- **Focus Management:** Return focus appropriately after actions
- **Color Contrast:** Ensure WCAG AA compliance for all text

### Edge Cases
- **Missing Data:** Gracefully handle missing bio, quotes, or related characters
- **Long Content:** Truncate very long bios with "read more" expansion
- **Many Episodes:** Paginate or virtualize lists with 100+ episodes
- **No Image:** Provide placeholder image or character initial
- **Special Characters:** Handle names with unicode, apostrophes, etc.
- **Concurrent Favorites:** Handle rapid favorite/unfavorite toggling

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Time:** < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Time to Interactive:** < 3 seconds
- **Image Load Time:** < 1 second for hero image

### Engagement Metrics
- **Page Views:** Track views per character page
- **Time on Page:** Average session duration (target: 2-3 minutes)
- **Favorite Rate:** % of users who favorite at least one character
- **Click-Through Rate:** % of users who navigate to related characters or episodes

### Quality Metrics
- **Bounce Rate:** < 40% (users who leave without interacting)
- **Error Rate:** < 1% of page loads result in errors
- **Accessibility Score:** Lighthouse score > 90

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (This Workshop)

- ❌ Server-side favorite sync
- ❌ Character comparison features

### Phase 2: Enhancements (Future)
**Goal:** Rich features and polish

- Character relationship visualization
- Server-side favorite sync with user accounts
- Social sharing features
- Character timelines/story arcs
- Spoiler controls

## Open Questions

**For Product Decision:**
1. **Spoiler Handling:** Should we add spoiler warnings or blur content for major plot points?
2. **Multi-Show Characters:** How do we handle characters that appear in multiple shows (crossovers, spin-offs)?
3. **User-Generated Content:** Should users be able to submit quotes or trivia?
4. **Cross-Device Sync:** What's the timeline for moving favorites from localStorage to server-backed accounts?

**For Technical Decision:**
1. **Missing Data UX:** What's the best way to handle characters with minimal information (no bio, few episodes)?
2. **Image Sources:** Do we have reliable image sources for all characters? Fallback strategy?
3. **SEO Optimization:** Should we implement server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO?
4. **Analytics:** What granular events should we track (scroll depth, quote clicks, etc.)?

**Workshop Note:** This feature serves as "The Golden Thread" throughout the Copilot Training workshop. Participants will implement this feature incrementally, using each module's techniques (instructions, prompts, agents, skills, etc.) to progressively build out the functionality. By the end of the workshop, this planned feature should be production-ready.
