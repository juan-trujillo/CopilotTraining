# Frontend Tests

No tests yet. The contractor said "React Testing Library is on the backlog."

Elena's notes:
- [ ] Component tests for all UI components
- [ ] Hook tests for custom hooks
- [ ] Integration tests for API calls
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Visual regression tests

Please write tests! 🙏
