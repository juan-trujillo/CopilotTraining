# Tech Talk Slide Generator

Generates `slides/tech-talks/{slug}.md` from `tech-talks/{topic}/README.md` and `deck.recipe.yml`.

Every slide uses a Vue component — no raw HTML. The component library handles all styling, color progression, dark/light theming, and cockpit chrome. Your job is editorial: choose the right component for each idea, fill props with curated content, and enforce the structural contract below.

---

## Judgment and Transfer Contract

Apply the universal contract in `AGENTS.md`. Preserve the reviewed recipe's practitioner decision, selected judgment lenses, observable proof, boundary, and own-work transfer. A slide that only inventories features does not earn space. Never compress away the evidence or limitation that makes a claim trustworthy.

---

## Mode

- **`patch` (default after a content refresh):** keep `slides/tech-talks/{slug}.md`. Update only slides whose claims changed. Do **not** clear the file. Do **not** rewrite Phase A scaffold. Build once at the end.
- **`regenerate`:** wipe and rewrite. Required when there is no deck, the recipe section order/thesis changed, or `slideImpact` is `regenerate` / `replace-demo`.

If the caller does not say regenerate and `content.refresh.yml` says `slideImpact: none|patch`, use patch.

## Pre-flight gates

Four quick checks — then immediately start writing. In patch mode, skip gate 4.

1. **README exists** — Confirm `tech-talks/{topic}/README.md` exists. If not, stop: "No README.md found. Generate it first via the Tech Talk Generator agent."
2. **Not archived** — Read only the README frontmatter. If `status: archived`, stop. Also refuse if the existing slide file has `status: archived`. In **regenerate** mode, do **not** read the existing deck body. In **patch** mode, read the existing deck and change only the slides whose claims moved.
3. **Read deck recipe + SECTIONS.md + template.md** — Look for `tech-talks/{topic}/deck.recipe.yml`.
   - **If it exists:** read it. Also read `slides/SECTIONS.md` and `slides/tech-talks/template.md` simultaneously — all three are required before writing Phase A. `SECTIONS.md` provides the `section:` frontmatter value; `template.md` provides every structural component schema and the correct import paths.
   - **If missing:** stop. Say: "No `deck.recipe.yml` found for this talk. Run the deck-recipe-review skill to create one, then re-invoke this agent."
   - Do **not** overwrite an existing recipe unless the user explicitly asks.
4. **Clear the output file (regenerate only)** — Before writing a single slide, run:
   ```powershell
   Set-Content "slides/tech-talks/{slug}.md" "<!-- generating -->" -Encoding UTF8NoBOM
   ```
   This must happen before Phase A. Never run this in patch mode.

→ **Regenerate:** all gates passed? Go directly to Phase A. Do not read the README yet.
→ **Patch:** skip Phase A. Read the existing deck + the accepted refresh items + the changed README sections, edit in place, then run one single-deck build.

## Phase A — Scaffold (recipe-driven)

The recipe contains everything needed to write the full structural skeleton. Start immediately.

> **Pre-flight loaded the recipe, SECTIONS.md, and template.md.** Use the schemas from the quick-reference below. Do NOT read the README, component `.vue` files, sibling decks, or memory files before writing — those reads happen in Phase B.

### Structural component schema quick-reference

Structural components import from `./components/structure/ComponentName.vue`. Body components from `./components/ComponentName.vue`.

| Component | Required props |
|-----------|---------------|
| `TitleSlide` | `title`, `subtitle`, `tagline`, `meta` |
| `CoreQuestionSlide` | `question`, `subtext`, `highlight`, `:cards='[{icon?, title, description}]'` — 6 cards; first 3 have `icon` (audience), last 3 are stats (no `icon`) |
| `TocSlide` | `:sections='[{icon, title, subtitle, blurb, slide}]'` — exactly 4 sections |
| `SectionOpenerSlide` | `:partNumber`, `title`, `subtitle`, `:cards='[{icon, title, blurb}]'` (3 cards), `:terminal='{context, detail}'` — NO `section`, NO `progressDots` |
| `BeforeAfterSlide` | `header`, `:leftItems='["..."]'` (4), `:rightItems='["..."]'` (4), `:metrics='[{value, detail}]'` (3) |
| `WhatYouCanDoTodaySlide` | `:today='["..."]'`, `:thisWeek='["..."]'`, `:thisMonth='["..."]'`, `footer="..."` |
| `ReferencesSlide` | `:groups='[{title, color, items: [{href?, label, description}]}]'` |
| `ThankYouSlide` | `title`, `subtitle`, `:cards="[{value, detail}]"` (2–4 cards), `prompt` |

**Prop syntax rule:** All array/object props use **single outer quotes** (`:prop='[...]'`). String values inside use double quotes. Keys are unquoted JS: `{title: "foo"}` not `{"title": "foo"}`.

Write the scaffold in one pass:

| Recipe field                                    | Used for                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deck.title` / `deck.subtitle` / `deck.tagline` | `TitleSlide` props                                                                                        |
| `deck.arcToc`                                   | `TocSlide` subtitle — the short → chain shown on the slide                                                |
| `deck.arcNarrative`                             | Authoring guidance — read before writing section openers to understand sequencing intent; never displayed |
| `deck.sectionOrder`                             | `TocSlide` section list; one `SectionOpenerSlide` per entry                                               |
| `deck.sectionModes[].note`                      | `SectionOpenerSlide` subtitle — verbatim or condensed to ≤ 120 chars                                      |
| `deck.sectionModes[].emphasis`                  | Budget comment after each opener: `high` = 4–5 slides, `medium` = 2–3, `medium-low` = 1–2                 |
| `deck.highlightMoments`                         | `BeforeAfterSlide` items/metrics; `WhatYouCanDoTodaySlide` actions; `ThankYouSlide` summary cards         |
| `deck.preamble`                                 | `src:` import blocks emitted immediately after `TitleSlide` (optional)                                    |
| `deck.appendix`                                 | `src:` import blocks emitted after `ThankYouSlide` (optional)                                             |

**Scaffold write order:**

1. Frontmatter (use `section:` value from SECTIONS.md, already read in pre-flight) + `<script setup>` import block
2. `TitleSlide` — `deck.title`, `deck.subtitle`, `deck.tagline`
3. **Preamble** — if `deck.preamble` exists, emit one `src:` block per entry immediately after the TitleSlide separator:
   ```
   ---
   src: {entry.src}
   ---
   ```
   Read each declared preamble before generation and import the components it uses into `<script setup>`.
4. `CoreQuestionSlide` — always next; use placeholder cards (3 persona + 3 stat) — fill in Phase B
5. `TocSlide` — sections from `deck.sectionOrder`; `slide: 0` placeholder — update after Phase B. **Do not emit an AgendaSlide** (retired; outcomes live in Core Question / TOC).
6. One `SectionOpenerSlide` per `deck.sectionOrder` entry; subtitle from `sectionModes[].note`; placeholder cards — immediately followed by `<!-- Phase B: {emphasis} — {N} body slides -->`
7. `BeforeAfterSlide` — derive left/right items and metrics from `deck.highlightMoments`
8. `WhatYouCanDoTodaySlide` — derive today/thisWeek/thisMonth from `deck.highlightMoments`
9. `ReferencesSlide` — use a single placeholder item; fill in Phase B after reading README
10. `ThankYouSlide` — 3 strongest `deck.highlightMoments` as summary cards
11. **Appendix** — if `deck.appendix` exists, emit one `src:` block per entry after the ThankYouSlide separator:
    ```
    ---
    src: {entry.src}
    ---
    ```

**After writing:** run `.\build.ps1 -Deck {slug}`. Fix any errors. The scaffold must build cleanly before Phase B begins.

---

## Phase B Pre-read: Body Component Reference

> **Before writing any body slide, review `slides/tech-talks/template.md` for the Tier-1 body component schemas.**

Template.md was already loaded in pre-flight for structural component schemas. In Phase B, your goal is the body-content Tier-1 components (BeforeAfterMetricsSlide, CodeWithFeaturesSlide, etc.):
- Each component has an **exact prop name and structure** documented with working examples
- Study the escaping rules and usage patterns
- This is your authoritative source — do not guess at prop names or structures

**Only AFTER you have the body component schemas in context should you write any body slide.**

---

## Phase B — Body content (README-driven)

Now read everything that Phase B needs — **all in one parallel pass before writing any body slides**. Issue all reads simultaneously, not sequentially:

- **`slides/tech-talks/template.md`** — already loaded in pre-flight for structural schemas; re-read now to focus on the Tier-1 body component schemas you are about to write. Do not read `slides/TEMPLATE.md`.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — apply the canonical editorial policy to every audience-facing prop value.
- **`tech-talks/{topic}/README.md`** — full read. Extract: core question, personas, before/after comparisons with metrics, key capabilities ranked by novelty and audience impact, references frontmatter.

Read all of these at the same time. Do not read one, then the next — fetch them all before synthesizing anything.

**Editorial curation — score content before choosing slides:**

| Axis                    | Question                                             | Signal                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision value**      | Will this change a consequential practitioner choice? | Clear criteria, authority boundary, tradeoff, or escalation path    |
| **Demonstration value** | Does an artifact make the mechanism and result visible? | Working configuration, command, workflow, output, or failure signal |
| **Transfer value**      | Can the audience apply and verify this in its own work? | Concrete next step, expected evidence, boundary, and recovery path  |

Identify the single technical reveal, honest tension, or boundary that changes how the audience approaches the core decision → make it the centerpiece of a section. Product novelty alone does not earn slide time. Compress or skip material that does not advance the decision, proof, or transfer.

**Per-slide clarity gate — apply before choosing a component:**

1. Write the audience question this slide answers in authoring notes or working memory. The visible headline may be the concise answer; it does not need a question mark.
2. Name the actor wherever agency changes the meaning. Say `Copilot requests the tool`, `the hook decides`, or `the service owner approves`; do not rely on passive phrases such as `work proceeds`.
3. Carry enough local context for a viewer entering on this slide to identify the actor, task, and consequence. Do not make the previous slide responsible for essential disambiguation.
4. For a behavioral claim, show the representative input or action beside its observable output or decision whenever practical. Preserve real field names and values when displaying payloads.
5. Separate verification status from the behavior being verified. For example, present `3/3 expected decisions verified` apart from the actual `allow`, `ask`, and `deny` results.

**Target: 20-25 slides total (never exceed 30).** Fixed positions:

```
Slide 1   — TitleSlide
Slide 2   — CoreQuestionSlide  (exactly 6 cards)
Slide 3   — TocSlide           (4 sections, slide numbers filled in at end)
Part 1    — SectionOpenerSlide (partNumber=1, cyan)
...body slides per sectionModes emphasis budget...
Part 2    — SectionOpenerSlide (partNumber=2, blue)
...
Part 3    — SectionOpenerSlide (partNumber=3, indigo)
...
Part 4    — SectionOpenerSlide (partNumber=4, purple)
...
N-3       — BeforeAfterSlide
N-2       — WhatYouCanDoTodaySlide
N-1       — ReferencesSlide
N         — ThankYouSlide
```

**Write every section, then build once.** Do not rebuild after each opener.

1. For each `deck.sectionOrder` entry: select body slides from the emphasis budget, fill opener cards, insert body slides, replace the `<!-- Phase B: ... -->` comment.
2. After all sections are written, run `.\build.ps1 -Deck {slug}` once. If it fails, fix the reported slide and rebuild. Do not restart Phase A.

**After all sections:**

6. Fill `CoreQuestionSlide` cards with real personas and stats from the README.
7. Fill `ReferencesSlide` from README references frontmatter.
8. Get real slide numbers by scanning the live deck — do not hand-count:
   ```powershell
   node scripts/inspect-slide.js {slug} scan
   ```
   Run from `slides/`. This starts (or reuses) a live Slidev dev session and reports every slide's number and name, derived the same way Slidev itself parses the deck. Each "Part N" opener line gives you the correct `slide:` value for `TocSlide`.
9. Update `TocSlide` with real `slide` values from step 8.
10. Run final build. Confirm `[OK]`.

If a build fails at any point, fix before proceeding.

### Frontmatter

```markdown
---
theme: default
class: text-center
highlighter: shiki
lineNumbers: false
info: |
  ## {Title}
  CopilotTraining Tech Talk
drawings:
  persist: false
transition: slide-left
title: { Title }
mdc: true
section: { value from SECTIONS.md }
status: active
updated: { YYYY-MM-DD }
---
```

### Import block

One `<script setup>` block at the top, immediately after frontmatter. Import only components the deck uses.

- **Structural components** (TitleSlide, CoreQuestionSlide, TocSlide, SectionOpenerSlide, BeforeAfterSlide, WhatYouCanDoTodaySlide, ReferencesSlide, ThankYouSlide): `import X from './components/structure/X.vue'`
- **Body content components** (all 13 Tier-1 components): `import X from './components/X.vue'`

See `slides/tech-talks/template.md` for the full canonical block (loaded in pre-flight).

**Critical:** Do NOT place a `---` separator between `</script>` and the first slide (`# Title`). The `</script>` block flows directly into the first slide with only a blank line.

### Slide heading requirement

Every slide **must** start with a Markdown heading (`#` as the first character of the line) naming the slide, with no blank line before the component tag:

```markdown
# Core Question
<CoreQuestionSlide
  ...
/>
```

This makes every slide self-describing in Slidev's own navigator/overview (no visual effect — the heading renders behind the component). It also lets `scripts/inspect-slide.js` derive slide names and numbers directly, instead of hand-counting.

### Component selection

Every body slide **must** use one of the 13 Tier-1 components. No inline HTML for body slides. The components handle cockpit wrapper, section chrome, color progression, and theming.

| Situation                              | Component                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Before → After with quantified metrics | `BeforeAfterMetricsSlide`     |
| Before → After without metrics         | `BeforeAfterPanelsSlide`      |
| Problem → Solution → Outcome           | `ProblemSolutionOutcomeSlide` |
| Two non-opposed concepts side-by-side  | `TwoColPairedConceptsSlide`   |
| Exactly 3 options/tiers                | `ThreeColumnCardSlide`        |
| Exactly 4 items in 2×2 grid            | `FourCardGridSlide`           |
| Code block + 2–4 feature cards         | `CodeWithFeaturesSlide`       |
| One dominant statistic + context       | `HeroStatSlide`               |
| Old vs new workflow, mirrored steps    | `WorkflowShowdownStepsSlide`  |
| Maturity/adoption stages (2–5)         | `MaturityJourneyRoadmapSlide` |
| AI terminal conversation               | `AITerminalTranscriptSlide`   |
| Single maturity level drilldown        | `MaturityLevelDrilldownSlide` |
| Multi-row concept taxonomy             | `FrameworkMappingRowsSlide`   |

If content does not fit any component, **adapt or split** — there is no inline HTML fallback.

### Universal component props

Every Tier-1 body component requires:

- `partNumber` (1–4) — drives all colors
- `pillIcon` + `pillLabel` — breadcrumb
- `title` — slide headline (≤ 80 chars)
- `progressDots: { current, total, activeColor }` — required on every body slide, even single-slide sections

`activeColor` by part:
| Part | activeColor |
|---|---|
| 1 | `"bg-cyan-400 shadow-lg shadow-cyan-500/50"` |
| 2 | `"bg-blue-400 shadow-lg shadow-blue-500/50"` |
| 3 | `"bg-indigo-400 shadow-lg shadow-indigo-500/50"` |
| 4 | `"bg-purple-400 shadow-lg shadow-purple-500/50"` |

Section openers do **not** get progress dots.

### Prop escaping rules

- All array/object props use **single outer quotes**: `:prop='[{key: "value"}]'` — this is the universal convention
- String values inside use **double quotes**; keys are **unquoted JS**: `{title: "foo"}` not `{"title": "foo"}`
- Apostrophes inside single-quoted outer props → use `&#39;` inside the double-quoted string value: `{description: "agent&#39;s key"}`
- Never use `&quot;`, `&#34;`, or `\"` inside any prop value — Vue decodes `&quot;`/`&#34;` before JS parses, breaking string boundaries; `\"` also confuses the parser
- Always leave a blank line between `/>` and the next `---` separator

---

## Step 3: Content limits

- Max 5 bullets per column
- Max 200 chars per paragraph
- Max 3 vertical div stacks per slide
- Code blocks on dedicated slides (use `CodeWithFeaturesSlide` or `AITerminalTranscriptSlide`)
- Prefer splitting over condensing

---

## Step 4: Update the index

After the deck builds cleanly:

- Add a card to `slides/index-custom.html` in the correct sub-group (use the section container from SECTIONS.md, already read in Phase B).
- Maintain alphabetical order within the sub-group.
- Card template: `<a href="/CopilotTraining/tech-talks/{slug}/" class="card"><h2>{Title}</h2><p>{One-sentence description}</p></a>`

---

## Step 5: Sync dates

Run `node slides/scripts/sync-index-dates.mjs` from `slides/` to update the "NEW" badge.

---

## Quality checklist

Run through this before handing off.

### Structure

- [ ] Slide 1: `TitleSlide` with `title`, `subtitle`, `tagline`, `meta`
- [ ] Slide 2: `CoreQuestionSlide` with `question`, `subtext`, `highlight` + exactly 6 cards (3 audience with `icon`, 3 stats without `icon`)
- [ ] Slide 3: `TocSlide` with exactly 4 sections each having `icon`, `title`, `subtitle`, `blurb`, `slide`; `slide` values come from `inspect-slide.js {slug} scan`, not estimates
- [ ] No `AgendaSlide` — retired; do not import or emit it
- [ ] Each Part N: `SectionOpenerSlide` with `partNumber`, `title`, `subtitle`, exactly 3 `cards` (with `blurb` not `description`), and `:terminal='{context, detail}'` — no `section` prop
- [ ] N-3: `BeforeAfterSlide` with exactly 4 left items, 4 right items, exactly 3 metrics
- [ ] N-2: `WhatYouCanDoTodaySlide` with `today`, `thisWeek`, `thisMonth`, `footer`
- [ ] N-1: `ReferencesSlide` — `href` for external links, omit for cross-references
- [ ] N: `ThankYouSlide` with `title`, `subtitle`, `cards` (2–4 items), `prompt`

### Components

- [ ] Every body slide uses one of the 13 Tier-1 components — zero inline HTML
- [ ] `progressDots` on every body slide (including single-slide sections)
- [ ] `partNumber` matches section position (1=cyan, 2=blue, 3=indigo, 4=purple)
- [ ] All `&#39;` escaping applied inside single-quoted array props
- [ ] No `&quot;` or `\"` in any prop value

### Editorial clarity

- [ ] Every slide has one unambiguous audience question and a visible answer; the headline may state the answer directly
- [ ] Copilot, agent, practitioner, control, and approver are named wherever changing the actor changes the meaning
- [ ] Each slide carries enough local context to identify the actor, task, and consequence
- [ ] Behavioral examples show representative input or action with the observable result whenever practical
- [ ] Test status is visually distinct from domain outcomes such as `allow`, `ask`, and `deny`

### Frontmatter & metadata

- [ ] `section:` value matches `slides/SECTIONS.md`
- [ ] `status: active` and `updated: {today}`
- [ ] Single `<script setup>` block, imports only what the deck uses

### Build & index

- [ ] `.\build.ps1 -Deck {slug}` exits with `[OK]`
- [ ] `index-custom.html` card added in correct section
- [ ] `sync-index-dates.mjs` run and shows deck in NEW list
- [ ] `deck.recipe.yml` exists next to README (created or pre-existing)

## Common mistakes

- `# Name` heading required on **every** slide including slide 1 — missing it shifts all TOC counts off by one and the slide falls back to a generic `Slide N` name in tooling
- `---` separator always on its own line — never `---# Heading` on the same line
- **Blank line required after `---`** — always leave an empty line between the `---` separator and the `# Name` heading that follows it. Missing this blank line causes Slidev to misparse the slide boundary.
- **No blank line between `# Heading` and the component tag** — the heading is followed immediately by the component, not a blank line then the component.
- No per-slide frontmatter (`layout:`, `class:`, `transition:`) — CSS only
- `SectionOpenerSlide` requires `:terminal` — omitting it causes a silent blank slide
- `ThankYouSlide` props are `title`, `subtitle`, `cards`, `prompt` — no `message`, no `links`
- TOC `slide` numbers must come from `node scripts/inspect-slide.js {slug} scan`, not estimated from the outline or hand-counted
- UTF-8 BOM breaks frontmatter — write files with `UTF8Encoding($false)` if using PowerShell
- **Guessing at component props** — Every body component is documented in `slides/tech-talks/template.md` with working examples. If you don't see it there, the prop doesn't exist. **Always check template.md BEFORE writing any component tags.**
- **BeforeAfterSlide vs BeforeAfterMetricsSlide** — These are different components with different props. Check template.md to determine which one the content calls for, then verify the exact prop schema.
- **Section openers don't use universal body props** — `SectionOpenerSlide` accepts `partNumber`, `title`, `subtitle`, `:cards` (with `blurb` not `description`), and `:terminal='{context, detail}'`. It does NOT accept `section`, `pillIcon`, `pillLabel`, or `progressDots`. Passing `section` or `:terminal="true"` produces a silent blank slide.
- **Import path split is load-bearing** — structural components live in `./components/structure/`; body components in `./components/`. Mixing these paths produces a module-not-found error at build time.
- **Adding props that don't exist breaks the build silently** — Vue components validate strict prop definitions. If you add a prop that doesn't exist on the component, Slidev will fail or ignore it. Always cross-reference with template.md working examples.
