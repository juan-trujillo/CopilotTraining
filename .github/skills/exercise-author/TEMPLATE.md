# Exercise N: [Feature Name]

## 🔨 Exercise

### Exercise N: [Title] — "[Subtitle]"

**Lead:** [Persona] | **Support:** [Persona2], [Persona3] | **Time:** XX min

#### 📖 The Challenge

[2-3 paragraphs showing the problem through multiple persona lenses. Structure:
- Open with the team's current situation
- Show how this affects different roles (mention personas by name)
- End with the specific pain point this exercise will address]

**Example:**
> Sarah needs to enforce React standards across 5 teams but reviewing every PR manually takes 45 minutes. David wants architectural patterns documented so junior devs don't reinvent solutions. Marcus keeps finding build configs that break because they violate unstated conventions. Right now, every standards violation requires manual correction and explanation.
