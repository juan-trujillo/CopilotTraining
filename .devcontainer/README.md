## Using This Dev Container

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. Click "Code" → "Create codespace on main"
2. Wait ~2-3 minutes for the environment to build
3. Everything is ready! Start with [Module 00](../modules/00-orientation/README.md)

### Option 2: VS Code Desktop with Dev Containers

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open this repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
5. Wait for the container to build

## Why Use the Dev Container?

**Consistent Environment** — Everyone gets the same tools, extensions, and configuration

**Zero Setup** — No manual extension installation or configuration

**Diagram Support** — Mermaid diagrams render immediately in Markdown previews

**FanHub Ready** — All development tools for the training project pre-installed

**Isolation** — Your training environment doesn't conflict with other projects

## Troubleshooting

### Mermaid Diagrams Not Rendering?

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Run "Markdown: Open Preview"
3. Diagrams should render with the `bierner.markdown-mermaid` extension

### Ports Not Forwarding?

Check the "Ports" tab in VS Code's terminal panel. Ports should auto-forward when services start.

### Container Build Fails?

Ensure Docker Desktop is running and you have enough disk space (5GB+ recommended).

## Customization

Want to add more extensions or change settings? Edit [devcontainer.json](./devcontainer.json) and rebuild:

1. Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
2. Wait for rebuild to complete
