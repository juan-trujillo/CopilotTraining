## 🏗️ Training Philosophy

### The Shift: Syntax Wizards → Markdown Whisperers

| Old Metrics | New Metrics |
|------------|-------------|
| Syntax memorization | Clear articulation of intent |
| Clever code only you understand | Code anyone can maintain |
| Fast typing | Fast thinking and design |
| Being the "only expert" | Scaling knowledge across the team |

In the age of AI assistance, the bottleneck isn't "can you write the code?" — it's "do you know what to build?"

> 💡 **Markdown Is the Medium**: Every `.md` file you write—instructions, prompts, agents, skills—is a direct conversation with AI. The most effective teams won't be those with the most elegant syntax; they'll be those with the best prose. Syntax is what AI writes for you. Markdown is what you write for AI.

### Four Principles

| Principle | Core Message |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Clarity Beats Cleverness** | Understandable code trumps clever code |
| 🎯 **Intent Over Implementation** | Describe WHAT, not HOW |
| 📚 **Documentation Is Leverage** | Write once, benefit infinitely |
| ⚖️ **Human Judgment Is Non-Negotiable** | AI proposes, you decide |

## 🔧 Content Development

New tech talks are generated through an automated 4-phase workflow:

1. **Research** — Copilot CLI gathers source material and examples from URLs
2. **Plan** — Content outline committed for review
3. **Build** — README.md generated from approved plan (`/approve-plan`)
4. **Slides** — Slidev deck generated from README

See the [Tech Talks Creation Guide](tech-talks/README.md) for detailed instructions on both the issue-based and local IDE workflows.

### Copilot Agents & Skills

Content development is powered by custom Copilot agents and skills that run inside VS Code:

| Agent / Skill | Purpose |
|---------------|--------|
| `@Module Creator` | End-to-end workshop module generation |
| `@Module Planner` | Research and plan module outlines |
| `@Tech Talk Generator` | Research and generate tech talk content |
| `@Slide Generator` | Create Slidev slides from README files |
| `@exercise-author` skill | Create exercise files from module plans |

Agent definitions live in `.github/agents/` and skills in `.github/skills/`.
