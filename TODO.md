# TODO: Workshop Reorganization

## ✅ COMPLETED: Agent Plan Mode Module (Module 2)

Module 2 has been created and integrated into the workshop structure.

## ✅ COMPLETED: Custom Skills Module (Module 6)

Module 6 has been created to introduce GitHub Copilot Agent Skills (Dec 2025 feature).

## ✅ COMPLETED: Module Reordering

All modules have been reorganized into the following structure:

**Current Structure:**
```
00-orientation/
01-repository-instructions/
02-agent-plan-mode/        ✅ CREATED
03-custom-prompts/         ✅ RENAMED (was 02)
04-custom-agents/          ✅ RENAMED (was 03)
05-custom-instructions/    ✅ RENAMED (was 04)
06-custom-skills/          ✅ CREATED (new GitHub feature)
07-copilot-web/            ✅ RENAMED (was 08-appendix-a)
08-copilot-cli/            ✅ RENAMED (was 09-appendix-b)
09-agentic-sdlc/           ✅ RENAMED (was 05)
```

**Total modules**: 9 core modules + orientation
**Time estimate**: 9-10 hours
**Narrative flow**: Plan Mode → Prompts → Agents → Instructions → Skills → Web → CLI → Agentic SDLC
