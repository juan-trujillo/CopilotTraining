## ✅ COMPLETED: Module Reordering

All modules have been reorganized into the following structure:

**Current Structure:**
```
00-orientation/
01-repository-instructions/
02-agent-plan-mode/        ✅ CREATED
03-custom-prompts/         ✅ RENAMED
04-custom-agents/          ✅ RENAMED
05-custom-instructions/    ✅ RENAMED
06-agent-skills/           ✅ CREATED (Agent Skills open standard)
07-mcp-servers/            ✅ CREATED (Model Context Protocol)
08-copilot-web/            ✅ RENAMED
09-copilot-cli/            ✅ RENAMED
10-agentic-sdlc/           ✅ RENAMED
11-enterprise-patterns/    ✅ RENAMED
```

**Total modules**: 11 core modules + orientation
**Time estimate**: 11-13 hours
**Narrative flow**: Plan Mode → Prompts → Agents → Instructions → Skills → MCP → Web → CLI → Agentic SDLC → Enterprise
